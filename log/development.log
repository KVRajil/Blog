It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Rails. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites installed:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby language version 1.9.3 or newer.\r\nThe RubyGems packaging system, which is installed with Ruby versions 1.9 and later. To learn more about RubyGems, please read the RubyGems Guides.\r\nA working installation of the SQLite3 Database.\r\nRails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Ruby:\r\n\r\nOfficial Ruby Programming Language website\r\nreSRC's List of Free Programming Books\r\nBe aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as 1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.\r\n\r\n2 What is Rails?\r\nRails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\r\n\r\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\r\n\r\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\r\n\r\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\r\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.\r\n3 Creating a New Rails Project\r\nThe best way to use this guide is to follow each step as it happens, no code or step needed to make this example application has been left out, so you can literally follow along step by step.\r\n\r\nBy following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called blog, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application, you need to make sure that you have Rails itself installed.\r\n\r\nThe examples below use $ to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS, though it may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows, your prompt will look something like c:\\source_code>\r\n\r\n3.1 Installing Rails\r\nOpen up a command line prompt. On Mac OS X open Terminal.app, on Windows choose \"Run\" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign $ should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a current version of Ruby installed:\r\n\r\nA number of tools exist to help you quickly install Ruby and Ruby on Rails on your system. Windows users can use Rails Installer, while Mac OS X users can use Tokaido.\r\n\r\n$ ruby -v\r\nruby 2.0.0p353\r\nIf you don't have Ruby installed have a look at ruby-lang.org for possible ways to install Ruby on your platform.\r\n\r\nMany popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3. Windows users and others can find installation instructions at the SQLite3 website. Verify that it is correctly installed and in your PATH:\r\n\r\n$ sqlite3 --version\r\nThe program should report its version.\r\n\r\nTo install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:\r\n\r\n$ gem install rails\r\nTo verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:\r\n\r\n$ rails --version\r\nIf it says something like \"Rails 4.2.1\", you are ready to continue.\r\n\r\n3.2 Creating the Blog Application\r\nRails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task. One of these is the new application generator, which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that you don't have to write it yourself.\r\n\r\nTo use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and type:\r\n\r\n$ rails new blog\r\nThis will create a Rails application called Blog in a blog directory and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in Gemfile using bundle install.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running rails new -h.\r\n\r\nAfter you create the blog application, switch to its folder:\r\n\r\n$ cd blog\r\nThe blog directory has a number of auto-generated files and folders that make up the structure of a Rails application. Most of the work in this tutorial will happen in the app folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each of the files and folders that Rails created by default:\r\n\r\nFile/Folder\tPurpose\r\napp/\tContains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.\r\nbin/\tContains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to setup, deploy or run your application.\r\nconfig/\tConfigure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in Configuring Rails Applications.\r\nconfig.ru\tRack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application.\r\ndb/\tContains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.\r\nGemfile\r\nGemfile.lock\tThese files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the Bundler website.\r\nlib/\tExtended modules for your application.\r\nlog/\tApplication log files.\r\npublic/\tThe only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.\r\nRakefile\tThis file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application.\r\nREADME.rdoc\tThis is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.\r\ntest/\tUnit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in Testing Rails Applications.\r\ntmp/\tTemporary files (like cache, pid, and session files).\r\nvendor/\tA place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.\r\n4 Hello, Rails!\r\nTo begin with, let's get some text up on screen quickly. To do this, you need to get your Rails application server running.\r\n\r\n4.1 Starting up the Web Server\r\nYou actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the following in the blog directory:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails server\r\nIf you are using Windows, you have to pass the scripts under the bin folder directly to the Ruby interpreter e.g. ruby bin\\rails server.\r\n\r\nCompiling CoffeeScript and JavaScript asset compression requires you have a JavaScript runtime available on your system, in the absence of a runtime you will see an execjs error during asset compilation. Usually Mac OS X and Windows come with a JavaScript runtime installed. Rails adds the therubyracer gem to the generated Gemfile in a commented line for new apps and you can uncomment if you need it. therubyrhino is the recommended runtime for JRuby users and is added by default to the Gemfile in apps generated under JRuby. You can investigate all the supported runtimes at ExecJS.\r\n\r\nThis will fire up WEBrick, a web server distributed with Ruby by default. To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Rails default information page:\r\n\r\nWelcome aboard screenshot\r\n\r\nTo stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running. To verify the server has stopped you should see your command prompt cursor again. For most UNIX-like systems including Mac OS X this will be a dollar sign $. In development mode, Rails does not generally require you to restart the server; changes you make in files will be automatically picked up by the server.\r\n\r\nThe \"Welcome aboard\" page is the smoke test for a new Rails application: it makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a page. You can also click on the About your application's environment link to see a summary of your application's environment.\r\n\r\n4.2 Say \"Hello\", Rails\r\nTo get Rails saying \"Hello\", you need to create at minimum a controller and a view.\r\n\r\nA controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. Routing decides which controller receives which requests. Often, there is more than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by different actions. Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.\r\n\r\nA view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format. An important distinction to make is that it is the controller, not the view, where information is collected. The view should just display that information. By default, view templates are written in a language called eRuby (Embedded Ruby) which is processed by the request cycle in Rails before being sent to the user.\r\n\r\nTo create a new controller, you will need to run the \"controller\" generator and tell it you want a controller called \"welcome\" with an action called \"index\", just like this:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller welcome index\r\nRails will create several files and a route for you.\r\n\r\ncreate  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb\r\n route  get 'welcome/index'\r\ninvoke  erb\r\ncreate    app/views/welcome\r\ncreate    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb\r\ninvoke  test_unit\r\ncreate    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb\r\ninvoke  helper\r\ncreate    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb\r\ninvoke  assets\r\ninvoke    coffee\r\ncreate      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.js.coffee\r\ninvoke    scss\r\ncreate      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.css.scss\r\nMost important of these are of course the controller, located at app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb and the view, located at app/views/welcome/index.html.erb.\r\n\r\nOpen the app/views/welcome/index.html.erb file in your text editor. Delete all of the existing code in the file, and replace it with the following single line of code:\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>\r\n4.3 Setting the Application Home Page\r\nNow that we have made the controller and view, we need to tell Rails when we want \"Hello, Rails!\" to show up. In our case, we want it to show up when we navigate to the root URL of our site, http://localhost:3000. At the moment, \"Welcome aboard\" is occupying that spot.\r\n\r\nNext, you have to tell Rails where your actual home page is located.\r\n\r\nOpen the file config/routes.rb in your editor.\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  get 'welcome/index'\r\n \r\n  # The priority is based upon order of creation:\r\n  # first created -> highest priority.\r\n  #\r\n  # You can have the root of your site routed with \"root\"\r\n  # root 'welcome#index'\r\n  #\r\n  # ...\r\nThis is your application's routing file which holds entries in a special DSL (domain-specific language) that tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions. This file contains many sample routes on commented lines, and one of them actually shows you how to connect the root of your site to a specific controller and action. Find the line beginning with root and uncomment it. It should look something like the following:\r\n\r\nroot 'welcome#index'\r\nroot 'welcome#index' tells Rails to map requests to the root of the application to the welcome controller's index action and get 'welcome/index' tells Rails to map requests to http://localhost:3000/welcome/index to the welcome controller's index action. This was created earlier when you ran the controller generator (bin/rails generate controller welcome index).\r\n\r\nLaunch the web server again if you stopped it to generate the controller (bin/rails\r\nserver) and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You'll see the \"Hello, Rails!\" message you put into app/views/welcome/index.html.erb, indicating that this new route is indeed going to WelcomeController's index action and is rendering the view correctly.\r\n\r\nFor more information about routing, refer to Rails Routing from the Outside In.\r\n\r\n5 Getting Up and Running\r\nNow that you've seen how to create a controller, an action and a view, let's create something with a bit more substance.\r\n\r\nIn the Blog application, you will now create a new resource. A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people or animals. You can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.\r\n\r\nRails provides a resources method which can be used to declare a standard REST resource. You need to add the article resource to the config/routes.rb as follows:\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n \r\n  resources :articles\r\n \r\n  root 'welcome#index'\r\nend\r\nIf you run bin/rake routes, you'll see that it has defined routes for all the standard RESTful actions. The meaning of the prefix column (and other columns) will be seen later, but for now notice that Rails has inferred the singular form article and makes meaningful use of the distinction.\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake routes\r\n      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action\r\n    articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\n             POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create\r\n new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new\r\nedit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit\r\n     article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\n             PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\n        root GET    /                            welcome#index\r\nIn the next section, you will add the ability to create new articles in your application and be able to view them. This is the \"C\" and the \"R\" from CRUD: creation and reading. The form for doing this will look like this:\r\n\r\nThe new article form\r\n\r\nIt will look a little basic for now, but that's ok. We'll look at improving the styling for it afterwards.\r\n\r\n5.1 Laying down the ground work\r\nFirstly, you need a place within the application to create a new article. A great place for that would be at /articles/new. With the route already defined, requests can now be made to /articles/new in the application. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/articles/new and you'll see a routing error:\r\n\r\nAnother routing error, uninitialized constant ArticlesController\r\n\r\nThis error occurs because the route needs to have a controller defined in order to serve the request. The solution to this particular problem is simple: create a controller called ArticlesController. You can do this by running this command:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller articles\r\nIf you open up the newly generated app/controllers/articles_controller.rb you'll see a fairly empty controller:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\nend\r\nA controller is simply a class that is defined to inherit from ApplicationController. It's inside this class that you'll define methods that will become the actions for this controller. These actions will perform CRUD operations on the articles within our system.\r\n\r\nThere are public, private and protected methods in Ruby,\r\nbut only public methods can be actions for controllers.\r\nFor more details check out Programming Ruby.\r\n\r\nIf you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new now, you'll get a new error:\r\n\r\nUnknown action new for ArticlesController!\r\n\r\nThis error indicates that Rails cannot find the new action inside the ArticlesController that you just generated. This is because when controllers are generated in Rails they are empty by default, unless you tell it your wanted actions during the generation process.\r\n\r\nTo manually define an action inside a controller, all you need to do is to define a new method inside the controller. Open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and inside the ArticlesController class, define a new method so that the controller now looks like this:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nWith the new method defined in ArticlesController, if you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll see another error:\r\n\r\nTemplate is missing for articles/new\r\n\r\nYou're getting this error now because Rails expects plain actions like this one to have views associated with them to display their information. With no view available, Rails errors out.\r\n\r\nIn the above image, the bottom line has been truncated. Let's see what the full thing looks like:\r\n\r\nMissing template articles/new, application/new with {locale:[:en], formats:[:html], handlers:[:erb, :builder, :coffee]}. Searched in: * \"/path/to/blog/app/views\"\r\n\r\nThat's quite a lot of text! Let's quickly go through and understand what each part of it does.\r\n\r\nThe first part identifies what template is missing. In this case, it's the articles/new template. Rails will first look for this template. If not found, then it will attempt to load a template called application/new. It looks for one here because the ArticlesController inherits from ApplicationController.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the message contains a hash. The :locale key in this hash simply indicates what spoken language template should be retrieved. By default, this is the English - or \"en\" - template. The next key, :formats specifies the format of template to be served in response. The default format is :html, and so Rails is looking for an HTML template. The final key, :handlers, is telling us what template handlers could be used to render our template. :erb is most commonly used for HTML templates, :builder is used for XML templates, and :coffee uses CoffeeScript to build JavaScript templates.\r\n\r\nThe final part of this message tells us where Rails has looked for the templates. Templates within a basic Rails application like this are kept in a single location, but in more complex applications it could be many different paths.\r\n\r\nThe simplest template that would work in this case would be one located at app/views/articles/new.html.erb. The extension of this file name is key: the first extension is the format of the template, and the second extension is the handler that will be used. Rails is attempting to find a template called articles/new within app/views for the application. The format for this template can only be html and the handler must be one of erb, builder or coffee. Because you want to create a new HTML form, you will be using the ERB language. Therefore the file should be called articles/new.html.erb and needs to be located inside the app/views directory of the application.\r\n\r\nGo ahead now and create a new file at app/views/articles/new.html.erb and write this content in it:\r\n\r\n<h1>New Article</h1>\r\nWhen you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll now see that the page has a title. The route, controller, action and view are now working harmoniously! It's time to create the form for a new article.\r\n\r\n5.2 The first form\r\nTo create a form within this template, you will use a form builder. The primary form builder for Rails is provided by a helper method called form_for. To use this method, add this code into app/views/articles/new.html.erb:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\nIf you refresh the page now, you'll see the exact same form as in the example. Building forms in Rails is really just that easy!\r\n\r\nWhen you call form_for, you pass it an identifying object for this form. In this case, it's the symbol :article. This tells the form_for helper what this form is for. Inside the block for this method, the FormBuilder object - represented by f - is used to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article. Finally, a call to submit on the f object will create a submit button for the form.\r\n\r\nThere's one problem with this form though. If you inspect the HTML that is generated, by viewing the source of the page, you will see that the action attribute for the form is pointing at /articles/new. This is a problem because this route goes to the very page that you're on right at the moment, and that route should only be used to display the form for a new article.\r\n\r\nThe form needs to use a different URL in order to go somewhere else. This can be done quite simply with the :url option of form_for. Typically in Rails, the action that is used for new form submissions like this is called \"create\", and so the form should be pointed to that action.\r\n\r\nEdit the form_for line inside app/views/articles/new.html.erb to look like this:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\nIn this example, the articles_path helper is passed to the :url option. To see what Rails will do with this, we look back at the output of bin/rake routes:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake routes\r\n      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action\r\n    articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\n             POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create\r\n new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new\r\nedit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit\r\n     article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\n             PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\n        root GET    /                            welcome#index\r\nThe articles_path helper tells Rails to point the form to the URI Pattern associated with the articles prefix; and the form will (by default) send a POST request to that route. This is associated with the create action of the current controller, the ArticlesController.\r\n\r\nWith the form and its associated route defined, you will be able to fill in the form and then click the submit button to begin the process of creating a new article, so go ahead and do that. When you submit the form, you should see a familiar error:\r\n\r\nUnknown action create for ArticlesController\r\n\r\nYou now need to create the create action within the ArticlesController for this to work.\r\n\r\n5.3 Creating articles\r\nTo make the \"Unknown action\" go away, you can define a create action within the ArticlesController class in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb, underneath the new action, as shown:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nIf you re-submit the form now, you'll see another familiar error: a template is missing. That's ok, we can ignore that for now. What the create action should be doing is saving our new article to the database.\r\n\r\nWhen a form is submitted, the fields of the form are sent to Rails as parameters. These parameters can then be referenced inside the controller actions, typically to perform a particular task. To see what these parameters look like, change the create action to this:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  render plain: params[:article].inspect\r\nend\r\nThe render method here is taking a very simple hash with a key of plain and value of params[:article].inspect. The params method is the object which represents the parameters (or fields) coming in from the form. The params method returns an ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess object, which allows you to access the keys of the hash using either strings or symbols. In this situation, the only parameters that matter are the ones from the form.\r\n\r\nEnsure you have a firm grasp of the params method, as you'll use it fairly regularly. Let's consider an example URL: http://www.example.com/?username=dhh&email=dhh@email.com. In this URL, params[:username] would equal \"dhh\" and params[:email] would equal \"dhh@email.com\".\r\n\r\nIf you re-submit the form one more time you'll now no longer get the missing template error. Instead, you'll see something that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n{\"title\"=>\"First article!\", \"text\"=>\"This is my first article.\"}\r\nThis action is now displaying the parameters for the article that are coming in from the form. However, this isn't really all that helpful. Yes, you can see the parameters but nothing in particular is being done with them.\r\n\r\n5.4 Creating the Article model\r\nModels in Rails use a singular name, and their corresponding database tables use a plural name. Rails provides a generator for creating models, which most Rails developers tend to use when creating new models. To create the new model, run this command in your terminal:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text\r\nWith that command we told Rails that we want a Article model, together with a title attribute of type string, and a text attribute of type text. Those attributes are automatically added to the articles table in the database and mapped to the Article model.\r\n\r\nRails responded by creating a bunch of files. For now, we're only interested in app/models/article.rb and db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb (your name could be a bit different). The latter is responsible for creating the database structure, which is what we'll look at next.\r\n\r\nActive Record is smart enough to automatically map column names to model attributes, which means you don't have to declare attributes inside Rails models, as that will be done automatically by Active Record.\r\n\r\n5.5 Running a Migration\r\nAs we've just seen, bin/rails generate model created a database migration file inside the db/migrate directory. Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables. Rails uses rake commands to run migrations, and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been applied to your database. Migration filenames include a timestamp to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.\r\n\r\nIf you look in the db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb file (remember, yours will have a slightly different name), here's what you'll find:\r\n\r\nclass CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :articles do |t|\r\n      t.string :title\r\n      t.text :text\r\n \r\n      t.timestamps null: false\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe above migration creates a method named change which will be called when you run this migration. The action defined in this method is also reversible, which means Rails knows how to reverse the change made by this migration, in case you want to reverse it later. When you run this migration it will create an articles table with one string column and a text column. It also creates two timestamp fields to allow Rails to track article creation and update times.\r\n\r\nFor more information about migrations, refer to Rails Database Migrations.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can use a rake command to run the migration:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\nRails will execute this migration command and tell you it created the Articles table.\r\n\r\n==  CreateArticles: migrating ==================================================\r\n-- create_table(:articles)\r\n   -> 0.0019s\r\n==  CreateArticles: migrated (0.0020s) =========================================\r\nBecause you're working in the development environment by default, this\r\ncommand will apply to the database defined in the development section of your\r\nconfig/database.yml file. If you would like to execute migrations in another\r\nenvironment, for instance in production, you must explicitly pass it when\r\ninvoking the command: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production.\r\n\r\n5.6 Saving data in the controller\r\nBack in ArticlesController, we need to change the create action to use the new Article model to save the data in the database. Open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and change the create action to look like this:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(params[:article])\r\n \r\n  @article.save\r\n  redirect_to @article\r\nend\r\nHere's what's going on: every Rails model can be initialized with its respective attributes, which are automatically mapped to the respective database columns. In the first line we do just that (remember that params[:article] contains the attributes we're interested in). Then, @article.save is responsible for saving the model in the database. Finally, we redirect the user to the show action, which we'll define later.\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering why the A in Article.new is capitalized above, whereas most other references to articles in this guide have used lowercase. In this context, we are referring to the class named Article that is defined in \\models\\article.rb. Class names in Ruby must begin with a capital letter.\r\n\r\nAs we'll see later, @article.save returns a boolean indicating whether the article was saved or not.\r\n\r\nIf you now go to http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll almost be able to create an article. Try it! You should get an error that looks like this:\r\n\r\nForbidden attributes for new article\r\n\r\nRails has several security features that help you write secure applications, and you're running into one of them now. This one is called strong parameters, which requires us to tell Rails exactly which parameters are allowed into our controller actions.\r\n\r\nWhy do you have to bother? The ability to grab and automatically assign all controller parameters to your model in one shot makes the programmer's job easier, but this convenience also allows malicious use. What if a request to the server was crafted to look like a new article form submit but also included extra fields with values that violated your applications integrity? They would be 'mass assigned' into your model and then into the database along with the good stuff - potentially breaking your application or worse.\r\n\r\nWe have to whitelist our controller parameters to prevent wrongful mass assignment. In this case, we want to both allow and require the title and text parameters for valid use of create. The syntax for this introduces require and permit. The change will involve one line in the create action:\r\n\r\n@article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text))\r\nThis is often factored out into its own method so it can be reused by multiple actions in the same controller, for example create and update. Above and beyond mass assignment issues, the method is often made private to make sure it can't be called outside its intended context. Here is the result:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  @article.save\r\n  redirect_to @article\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nFor more information, refer to the reference above and this blog article about Strong Parameters.\r\n\r\n5.7 Showing Articles\r\nIf you submit the form again now, Rails will complain about not finding the show action. That's not very useful though, so let's add the show action before proceeding.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the output of bin/rake routes, the route for show action is as follows:\r\n\r\narticle GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\nThe special syntax :id tells rails that this route expects an :id parameter, which in our case will be the id of the article.\r\n\r\nAs we did before, we need to add the show action in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and its respective view.\r\n\r\nA frequent practice is to place the standard CRUD actions in each\r\ncontroller in the following order: index, show, new, edit, create, update\r\nand destroy. You may use any order you choose, but keep in mind that these\r\nare public methods; as mentioned earlier in this guide, they must be placed\r\nbefore any private or protected method in the controller in order to work.\r\n\r\nGiven that, let's add the show action, as follows:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nA couple of things to note. We use Article.find to find the article we're interested in, passing in params[:id] to get the :id parameter from the request. We also use an instance variable (prefixed with @) to hold a reference to the article object. We do this because Rails will pass all instance variables to the view.\r\n\r\nNow, create a new file app/views/articles/show.html.erb with the following content:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\nWith this change, you should finally be able to create new articles. Visit http://localhost:3000/articles/new and give it a try!\r\n\r\nShow action for articles\r\n\r\n5.8 Listing all articles\r\nWe still need a way to list all our articles, so let's do that. The route for this as per output of bin/rake routes is:\r\n\r\narticles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\nAdd the corresponding index action for that route inside the ArticlesController in the app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file. When we write an index action, the usual practice is to place it as the first method in the controller. Let's do it:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nAnd then finally, add the view for this action, located at app/views/articles/index.html.erb:\r\n\r\n<h1>Listing articles</h1>\r\n \r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nNow if you go to http://localhost:3000/articles you will see a list of all the articles that you have created.\r\n\r\n5.9 Adding links\r\nYou can now create, show, and list articles. Now let's add some links to navigate through pages.\r\n\r\nOpen app/views/welcome/index.html.erb and modify it as follows:\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>\r\n<%= link_to 'My Blog', controller: 'articles' %>\r\nThe link_to method is one of Rails' built-in view helpers. It creates a hyperlink based on text to display and where to go - in this case, to the path for articles.\r\n\r\nLet's add links to the other views as well, starting with adding this \"New Article\" link to app/views/articles/index.html.erb, placing it above the <table> tag:\r\n\r\n<%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %>\r\nThis link will allow you to bring up the form that lets you create a new article.\r\n\r\nNow, add another link in app/views/articles/new.html.erb, underneath the form, to go back to the index action:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\n  ...\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nFinally, add a link to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template to go back to the index action as well, so that people who are viewing a single article can go back and view the whole list again:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nIf you want to link to an action in the same controller, you don't need to specify the :controller option, as Rails will use the current controller by default.\r\n\r\nIn development mode (which is what you're working in by default), Rails reloads your application with every browser request, so there's no need to stop and restart the web server when a change is made.\r\n\r\n5.10 Adding Some Validation\r\nThe model file, app/models/article.rb is about as simple as it can get:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\nend\r\nThere isn't much to this file - but note that the Article class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. Active Record supplies a great deal of functionality to your Rails models for free, including basic database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations, data validation, as well as sophisticated search support and the ability to relate multiple models to one another.\r\n\r\nRails includes methods to help you validate the data that you send to models. Open the app/models/article.rb file and edit it:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\nThese changes will ensure that all articles have a title that is at least five characters long. Rails can validate a variety of conditions in a model, including the presence or uniqueness of columns, their format, and the existence of associated objects. Validations are covered in detail in Active Record Validations.\r\n\r\nWith the validation now in place, when you call @article.save on an invalid article, it will return false. If you open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb again, you'll notice that we don't check the result of calling @article.save inside the create action. If @article.save fails in this situation, we need to show the form back to the user. To do this, change the new and create actions inside app/controllers/articles_controller.rb to these:\r\n\r\ndef new\r\n  @article = Article.new\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nThe new action is now creating a new instance variable called @article, and you'll see why that is in just a few moments.\r\n\r\nNotice that inside the create action we use render instead of redirect_to when save returns false. The render method is used so that the @article object is passed back to the new template when it is rendered. This rendering is done within the same request as the form submission, whereas the redirect_to will tell the browser to issue another request.\r\n\r\nIf you reload http://localhost:3000/articles/new and try to save an article without a title, Rails will send you back to the form, but that's not very useful. You need to tell the user that something went wrong. To do that, you'll modify app/views/articles/new.html.erb to check for error messages:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nA few things are going on. We check if there are any errors with @article.errors.any?, and in that case we show a list of all errors with @article.errors.full_messages.\r\n\r\npluralize is a rails helper that takes a number and a string as its arguments. If the number is greater than one, the string will be automatically pluralized.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we added @article = Article.new in the ArticlesController is that otherwise @article would be nil in our view, and calling @article.errors.any? would throw an error.\r\n\r\nRails automatically wraps fields that contain an error with a div with class field_with_errors. You can define a css rule to make them standout.\r\n\r\nNow you'll get a nice error message when saving an article without title when you attempt to do just that on the new article form http://localhost:3000/articles/new:\r\n\r\nForm With Errors\r\n\r\n5.11 Updating Articles\r\nWe've covered the \"CR\" part of CRUD. Now let's focus on the \"U\" part, updating articles.\r\n\r\nThe first step we'll take is adding an edit action to the ArticlesController, generally between the new and create actions, as shown:\r\n\r\ndef new\r\n  @article = Article.new\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef edit\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe view will contain a form similar to the one we used when creating new articles. Create a file called app/views/articles/edit.html.erb and make it look as follows:\r\n\r\n<h1>Editing article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= form_for :article, url: article_path(@article), method: :patch do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis time we point the form to the update action, which is not defined yet but will be very soon.\r\n\r\nThe method: :patch option tells Rails that we want this form to be submitted via the PATCH HTTP method which is the HTTP method you're expected to use to update resources according to the REST protocol.\r\n\r\nThe first parameter of form_for can be an object, say, @article which would cause the helper to fill in the form with the fields of the object. Passing in a symbol (:article) with the same name as the instance variable (@article) also automagically leads to the same behavior. This is what is happening here. More details can be found in form_for documentation.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to create the update action in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb. Add it between the create action and the private method:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef update\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n \r\n  if @article.update(article_params)\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'edit'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nThe new method, update, is used when you want to update a record that already exists, and it accepts a hash containing the attributes that you want to update. As before, if there was an error updating the article we want to show the form back to the user.\r\n\r\nWe reuse the article_params method that we defined earlier for the create action.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to pass all attributes to update. For example, if you'd call @article.update(title: 'A new title') Rails would only update the title attribute, leaving all other attributes untouched.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to show a link to the edit action in the list of all the articles, so let's add that now to app/views/articles/index.html.erb to make it appear next to the \"Show\" link:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"2\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nAnd we'll also add one to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template as well, so that there's also an \"Edit\" link on an article's page. Add this at the bottom of the template:\r\n\r\n...\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nAnd here's how our app looks so far:\r\n\r\nIndex action with edit link\r\n\r\n5.12 Using partials to clean up duplication in views\r\nOur edit page looks very similar to the new page; in fact, they both share the same code for displaying the form. Let's remove this duplication by using a view partial. By convention, partial files are prefixed with an underscore.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about partials in the Layouts and Rendering in Rails guide.\r\n\r\nCreate a new file app/views/articles/_form.html.erb with the following content:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for @article do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\nEverything except for the form_for declaration remained the same. The reason we can use this shorter, simpler form_for declaration to stand in for either of the other forms is that @article is a resource corresponding to a full set of RESTful routes, and Rails is able to infer which URI and method to use. For more information about this use of form_for, see Resource-oriented style.\r\n\r\nNow, let's update the app/views/articles/new.html.erb view to use this new partial, rewriting it completely:\r\n\r\n<h1>New article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= render 'form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThen do the same for the app/views/articles/edit.html.erb view:\r\n\r\n<h1>Edit article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= render 'form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\n5.13 Deleting Articles\r\nWe're now ready to cover the \"D\" part of CRUD, deleting articles from the database. Following the REST convention, the route for deleting articles as per output of bin/rake routes is:\r\n\r\nDELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\nThe delete routing method should be used for routes that destroy resources. If this was left as a typical get route, it could be possible for people to craft malicious URLs like this:\r\n\r\n<a href='http://example.com/articles/1/destroy'>look at this cat!</a>\r\nWe use the delete method for destroying resources, and this route is mapped to the destroy action inside app/controllers/articles_controller.rb, which doesn't exist yet. The destroy method is generally the last CRUD action in the controller, and like the other public CRUD actions, it must be placed before any private or protected methods. Let's add it:\r\n\r\ndef destroy\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  @article.destroy\r\n \r\n  redirect_to articles_path\r\nend\r\nThe complete ArticlesController in the app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file should now look like this:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n    @article = Article.new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def edit\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n    if @article.save\r\n      redirect_to @article\r\n    else\r\n      render 'new'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def update\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n \r\n    if @article.update(article_params)\r\n      redirect_to @article\r\n    else\r\n      render 'edit'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def destroy\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n    @article.destroy\r\n \r\n    redirect_to articles_path\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def article_params\r\n      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nYou can call destroy on Active Record objects when you want to delete them from the database. Note that we don't need to add a view for this action since we're redirecting to the index action.\r\n\r\nFinally, add a 'Destroy' link to your index action template (app/views/articles/index.html.erb) to wrap everything together.\r\n\r\n<h1>Listing Articles</h1>\r\n<%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"3\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', article_path(article),\r\n              method: :delete,\r\n              data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nHere we're using link_to in a different way. We pass the named route as the second argument, and then the options as another argument. The :method and :'data-confirm' options are used as HTML5 attributes so that when the link is clicked, Rails will first show a confirm dialog to the user, and then submit the link with method delete. This is done via the JavaScript file jquery_ujs which is automatically included into your application's layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) when you generated the application. Without this file, the confirmation dialog box wouldn't appear.\r\n\r\nConfirm Dialog\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you can now create, show, list, update and destroy articles.\r\n\r\nIn general, Rails encourages using resources objects instead of declaring routes manually. For more information about routing, see Rails Routing from the Outside In.\r\n\r\n6 Adding a Second Model\r\nIt's time to add a second model to the application. The second model will handle comments on articles.\r\n\r\n6.1 Generating a Model\r\nWe're going to see the same generator that we used before when creating the Article model. This time we'll create a Comment model to hold reference of article comments. Run this command in your terminal:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references\r\nThis command will generate four files:\r\n\r\nFile\tPurpose\r\ndb/migrate/20140120201010_create_comments.rb\tMigration to create the comments table in your database (your name will include a different timestamp)\r\napp/models/comment.rb\tThe Comment model\r\ntest/models/comment_test.rb\tTesting harness for the comments model\r\ntest/fixtures/comments.yml\tSample comments for use in testing\r\nFirst, take a look at app/models/comment.rb:\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article\r\nend\r\nThis is very similar to the Article model that you saw earlier. The difference is the line belongs_to :article, which sets up an Active Record association. You'll learn a little about associations in the next section of this guide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the model, Rails has also made a migration to create the corresponding database table:\r\n\r\nclass CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :comments do |t|\r\n      t.string :commenter\r\n      t.text :body\r\n      t.references :article, index: true, foreign_key: true\r\n \r\n      t.timestamps null: false\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe t.references line creates an integer column called article_id, an index for it, and a foreign key constraint that points to the articles table. Go ahead and run the migration:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\nRails is smart enough to only execute the migrations that have not already been run against the current database, so in this case you will just see:\r\n\r\n==  CreateComments: migrating =================================================\r\n-- create_table(:comments)\r\n   -> 0.0115s\r\n==  CreateComments: migrated (0.0119s) ========================================\r\n6.2 Associating Models\r\nActive Record associations let you easily declare the relationship between two models. In the case of comments and articles, you could write out the relationships this way:\r\n\r\nEach comment belongs to one article.\r\nOne article can have many comments.\r\nIn fact, this is very close to the syntax that Rails uses to declare this association. You've already seen the line of code inside the Comment model (app/models/comment.rb) that makes each comment belong to an Article:\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article\r\nend\r\nYou'll need to edit app/models/article.rb to add the other side of the association:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\nThese two declarations enable a good bit of automatic behavior. For example, if you have an instance variable @article containing an article, you can retrieve all the comments belonging to that article as an array using @article.comments.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Active Record associations, see the Active Record Associations guide.\r\n\r\n6.3 Adding a Route for Comments\r\nAs with the welcome controller, we will need to add a route so that Rails knows where we would like to navigate to see comments. Open up the config/routes.rb file again, and edit it as follows:\r\n\r\nresources :articles do\r\n  resources :comments\r\nend\r\nThis creates comments as a nested resource within articles. This is another part of capturing the hierarchical relationship that exists between articles and comments.\r\n\r\nFor more information on routing, see the Rails Routing guide.\r\n\r\n6.4 Generating a Controller\r\nWith the model in hand, you can turn your attention to creating a matching controller. Again, we'll use the same generator we used before:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller Comments\r\nThis creates five files and one empty directory:\r\n\r\nFile/Directory\tPurpose\r\napp/controllers/comments_controller.rb\tThe Comments controller\r\napp/views/comments/\tViews of the controller are stored here\r\ntest/controllers/comments_controller_test.rb\tThe test for the controller\r\napp/helpers/comments_helper.rb\tA view helper file\r\napp/assets/javascripts/comment.js.coffee\tCoffeeScript for the controller\r\napp/assets/stylesheets/comment.css.scss\tCascading style sheet for the controller\r\nLike with any blog, our readers will create their comments directly after reading the article, and once they have added their comment, will be sent back to the article show page to see their comment now listed. Due to this, our CommentsController is there to provide a method to create comments and delete spam comments when they arrive.\r\n\r\nSo first, we'll wire up the Article show template (app/views/articles/show.html.erb) to let us make a new comment:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis adds a form on the Article show page that creates a new comment by calling the CommentsController create action. The form_for call here uses an array, which will build a nested route, such as /articles/1/comments.\r\n\r\nLet's wire up the create in app/controllers/comments_controller.rb:\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def comment_params\r\n      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nYou'll see a bit more complexity here than you did in the controller for articles. That's a side-effect of the nesting that you've set up. Each request for a comment has to keep track of the article to which the comment is attached, thus the initial call to the find method of the Article model to get the article in question.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the code takes advantage of some of the methods available for an association. We use the create method on @article.comments to create and save the comment. This will automatically link the comment so that it belongs to that particular article.\r\n\r\nOnce we have made the new comment, we send the user back to the original article using the article_path(@article) helper. As we have already seen, this calls the show action of the ArticlesController which in turn renders the show.html.erb template. This is where we want the comment to show, so let's add that to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<% @article.comments.each do |comment| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n    <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n    <%= comment.body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nNow you can add articles and comments to your blog and have them show up in the right places.\r\n\r\nArticle with Comments\r\n\r\n7 Refactoring\r\nNow that we have articles and comments working, take a look at the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template. It is getting long and awkward. We can use partials to clean it up.\r\n\r\n7.1 Rendering Partial Collections\r\nFirst, we will make a comment partial to extract showing all the comments for the article. Create the file app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb and put the following into it:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.body %>\r\n</p>\r\nThen you can change app/views/articles/show.html.erb to look like the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<%= render @article.comments %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis will now render the partial in app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb once for each comment that is in the @article.comments collection. As the render method iterates over the @article.comments collection, it assigns each comment to a local variable named the same as the partial, in this case comment which is then available in the partial for us to show.\r\n\r\n7.2 Rendering a Partial Form\r\nLet us also move that new comment section out to its own partial. Again, you create a file app/views/comments/_form.html.erb containing:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\nThen you make the app/views/articles/show.html.erb look like the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<%= render @article.comments %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= render 'comments/form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThe second render just defines the partial template we want to render, comments/form. Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to render the _form.html.erb file in the app/views/comments directory.\r\n\r\nThe @article object is available to any partials rendered in the view because we defined it as an instance variable.\r\n\r\n8 Deleting Comments\r\nAnother important feature of a blog is being able to delete spam comments. To do this, we need to implement a link of some sort in the view and a destroy action in the CommentsController.\r\n\r\nSo first, let's add the delete link in the app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb partial:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.body %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <%= link_to 'Destroy Comment', [comment.article, comment],\r\n               method: :delete,\r\n               data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>\r\n</p>\r\nClicking this new \"Destroy Comment\" link will fire off a DELETE\r\n/articles/:article_id/comments/:id to our CommentsController, which can then use this to find the comment we want to delete, so let's add a destroy action to our controller (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb):\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def destroy\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.find(params[:id])\r\n    @comment.destroy\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def comment_params\r\n      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nThe destroy action will find the article we are looking at, locate the comment within the @article.comments collection, and then remove it from the database and send us back to the show action for the article.\r\n\r\n8.1 Deleting Associated Objects\r\nIf you delete an article, its associated comments will also need to be deleted, otherwise they would simply occupy space in the database. Rails allows you to use the dependent option of an association to achieve this. Modify the Article model, app/models/article.rb, as follows:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\n9 Security\r\n9.1 Basic Authentication\r\nIf you were to publish your blog online, anyone would be able to add, edit and delete articles or delete comments.\r\n\r\nRails provides a very simple HTTP authentication system that will work nicely in this situation.\r\n\r\nIn the ArticlesController we need to have a way to block access to the various actions if the person is not authenticated. Here we can use the Rails http_basic_authenticate_with method, which allows access to the requested action if that method allows it.\r\n\r\nTo use the authentication system, we specify it at the top of our ArticlesController in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb. In our case, we want the user to be authenticated on every action except index and show, so we write that:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n \r\n  http_basic_authenticate_with name: \"dhh\", password: \"secret\", except: [:index, :show]\r\n \r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nWe also want to allow only authenticated users to delete comments, so in the CommentsController (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb) we write:\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n \r\n  http_basic_authenticate_with name: \"dhh\", password: \"secret\", only: :destroy\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nNow if you try to create a new article, you will be greeted with a basic HTTP Authentication challenge:\r\n\r\nBasic HTTP Authentication Challenge\r\n\r\nOther authentication methods are available for Rails applications. Two popular authentication add-ons for Rails are the Devise rails engine and the Authlogic gem, along with a number of others.\r\n\r\n9.2 Other Security Considerations\r\nSecurity, especially in web applications, is a broad and detailed area. Security in your Rails application is covered in more depth in the Ruby on Rails Security Guide.\r\n\r\n10 What's Next?\r\nNow that you've seen your first Rails application, you should feel free to update it and experiment on your own. But you don't have to do everything without help. As you need assistance getting up and running with Rails, feel free to consult these support resources:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby on Rails Guides\r\nThe Ruby on Rails Tutorial\r\nThe Ruby on Rails mailing list\r\nThe #rubyonrails channel on irc.freenode.net\r\nRails also comes with built-in help that you can generate using the rake command-line utility:\r\n\r\nRunning rake doc:guides will put a full copy of the Rails Guides in the doc/guides folder of your application. Open doc/guides/index.html in your web browser to explore the Guides.\r\nRunning rake doc:rails will put a full copy of the API documentation for Rails in the doc/api folder of your application. Open doc/api/index.html in your web browser to explore the API documentation.\r\nTo be able to generate the Rails Guides locally with the doc:guides rake task you need to install the RedCloth and Nokogiri gems. Add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install and you're ready to go.\r\n\r\n11 Configuration Gotchas\r\nThe easiest way to work with Rails is to store all external data as UTF-8. If you don't, Ruby libraries and Rails will often be able to convert your native data into UTF-8, but this doesn't always work reliably, so you're better off ensuring that all external data is UTF-8.\r\n\r\nIf you have made a mistake in this area, the most common symptom is a black diamond with a question mark inside appearing in the browser. Another common symptom is characters like \"Ã¼\" appearing instead of \"ü\". Rails takes a number of internal steps to mitigate common causes of these problems that can be automatically detected and corrected. However, if you have external data that is not stored as UTF-8, it can occasionally result in these kinds of issues that cannot be automatically detected by Rails and corrected.\r\n\r\nTwo very common sources of data that are not UTF-8:\r\n\r\nYour text editor: Most text editors (such as TextMate), default to saving files as UTF-8. If your text editor does not, this can result in special characters that you enter in your templates (such as é) to appear as a diamond with a question mark inside in the browser. This also applies to your i18n translation files. Most editors that do not already default to UTF-8 (such as some versions of Dreamweaver) offer a way to change the default to UTF-8. Do so.\r\nYour database: Rails defaults to converting data from your database into UTF-8 at the boundary. However, if your database is not using UTF-8 internally, it may not be able to store all characters that your users enter. For instance, if your database is using Latin-1 internally, and your user enters a Russian, Hebrew, or Japanese character, the data will be lost forever once it enters the database. If possible, use UTF-8 as the internal storage of your database.\r\nFeedback\r\nYou're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide.\r\n\r\nPlease contribute if you see any typos or factual errors.

It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Rails. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites installed:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby language version 1.9.3 or newer.\r\nThe RubyGems packaging system, which is installed with Ruby versions 1.9 and later. To learn more about RubyGems, please read the RubyGems Guides.\r\nA working installation of the SQLite3 Database.\r\nRails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Ruby:\r\n\r\nOfficial Ruby Programming Language website\r\nreSRC's List of Free Programming Books\r\nBe aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as 1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.\r\n\r\n2 What is Rails?\r\nRails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\r\n\r\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\r\n\r\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\r\n\r\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\r\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.\r\n3 Creating a New Rails Project\r\nThe best way to use this guide is to follow each step as it happens, no code or step needed to make this example application has been left out, so you can literally follow along step by step.\r\n\r\nBy following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called blog, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application, you need to make sure that you have Rails itself installed.\r\n\r\nThe examples below use $ to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS, though it may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows, your prompt will look something like c:\\source_code>\r\n\r\n3.1 Installing Rails\r\nOpen up a command line prompt. On Mac OS X open Terminal.app, on Windows choose \"Run\" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign $ should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a current version of Ruby installed:\r\n\r\nA number of tools exist to help you quickly install Ruby and Ruby on Rails on your system. Windows users can use Rails Installer, while Mac OS X users can use Tokaido.\r\n\r\n$ ruby -v\r\nruby 2.0.0p353\r\nIf you don't have Ruby installed have a look at ruby-lang.org for possible ways to install Ruby on your platform.\r\n\r\nMany popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3. Windows users and others can find installation instructions at the SQLite3 website. Verify that it is correctly installed and in your PATH:\r\n\r\n$ sqlite3 --version\r\nThe program should report its version.\r\n\r\nTo install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:\r\n\r\n$ gem install rails\r\nTo verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:\r\n\r\n$ rails --version\r\nIf it says something like \"Rails 4.2.1\", you are ready to continue.\r\n\r\n3.2 Creating the Blog Application\r\nRails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task. One of these is the new application generator, which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that you don't have to write it yourself.\r\n\r\nTo use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and type:\r\n\r\n$ rails new blog\r\nThis will create a Rails application called Blog in a blog directory and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in Gemfile using bundle install.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running rails new -h.\r\n\r\nAfter you create the blog application, switch to its folder:\r\n\r\n$ cd blog\r\nThe blog directory has a number of auto-generated files and folders that make up the structure of a Rails application. Most of the work in this tutorial will happen in the app folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each of the files and folders that Rails created by default:\r\n\r\nFile/Folder\tPurpose\r\napp/\tContains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.\r\nbin/\tContains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to setup, deploy or run your application.\r\nconfig/\tConfigure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in Configuring Rails Applications.\r\nconfig.ru\tRack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application.\r\ndb/\tContains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.\r\nGemfile\r\nGemfile.lock\tThese files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the Bundler website.\r\nlib/\tExtended modules for your application.\r\nlog/\tApplication log files.\r\npublic/\tThe only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.\r\nRakefile\tThis file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application.\r\nREADME.rdoc\tThis is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.\r\ntest/\tUnit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in Testing Rails Applications.\r\ntmp/\tTemporary files (like cache, pid, and session files).\r\nvendor/\tA place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.\r\n4 Hello, Rails!\r\nTo begin with, let's get some text up on screen quickly. To do this, you need to get your Rails application server running.\r\n\r\n4.1 Starting up the Web Server\r\nYou actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the following in the blog directory:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails server\r\nIf you are using Windows, you have to pass the scripts under the bin folder directly to the Ruby interpreter e.g. ruby bin\\rails server.\r\n\r\nCompiling CoffeeScript and JavaScript asset compression requires you have a JavaScript runtime available on your system, in the absence of a runtime you will see an execjs error during asset compilation. Usually Mac OS X and Windows come with a JavaScript runtime installed. Rails adds the therubyracer gem to the generated Gemfile in a commented line for new apps and you can uncomment if you need it. therubyrhino is the recommended runtime for JRuby users and is added by default to the Gemfile in apps generated under JRuby. You can investigate all the supported runtimes at ExecJS.\r\n\r\nThis will fire up WEBrick, a web server distributed with Ruby by default. To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Rails default information page:\r\n\r\nWelcome aboard screenshot\r\n\r\nTo stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running. To verify the server has stopped you should see your command prompt cursor again. For most UNIX-like systems including Mac OS X this will be a dollar sign $. In development mode, Rails does not generally require you to restart the server; changes you make in files will be automatically picked up by the server.\r\n\r\nThe \"Welcome aboard\" page is the smoke test for a new Rails application: it makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a page. You can also click on the About your application's environment link to see a summary of your application's environment.\r\n\r\n4.2 Say \"Hello\", Rails\r\nTo get Rails saying \"Hello\", you need to create at minimum a controller and a view.\r\n\r\nA controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. Routing decides which controller receives which requests. Often, there is more than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by different actions. Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.\r\n\r\nA view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format. An important distinction to make is that it is the controller, not the view, where information is collected. The view should just display that information. By default, view templates are written in a language called eRuby (Embedded Ruby) which is processed by the request cycle in Rails before being sent to the user.\r\n\r\nTo create a new controller, you will need to run the \"controller\" generator and tell it you want a controller called \"welcome\" with an action called \"index\", just like this:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller welcome index\r\nRails will create several files and a route for you.\r\n\r\ncreate  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb\r\n route  get 'welcome/index'\r\ninvoke  erb\r\ncreate    app/views/welcome\r\ncreate    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb\r\ninvoke  test_unit\r\ncreate    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb\r\ninvoke  helper\r\ncreate    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb\r\ninvoke  assets\r\ninvoke    coffee\r\ncreate      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.js.coffee\r\ninvoke    scss\r\ncreate      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.css.scss\r\nMost important of these are of course the controller, located at app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb and the view, located at app/views/welcome/index.html.erb.\r\n\r\nOpen the app/views/welcome/index.html.erb file in your text editor. Delete all of the existing code in the file, and replace it with the following single line of code:\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>\r\n4.3 Setting the Application Home Page\r\nNow that we have made the controller and view, we need to tell Rails when we want \"Hello, Rails!\" to show up. In our case, we want it to show up when we navigate to the root URL of our site, http://localhost:3000. At the moment, \"Welcome aboard\" is occupying that spot.\r\n\r\nNext, you have to tell Rails where your actual home page is located.\r\n\r\nOpen the file config/routes.rb in your editor.\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  get 'welcome/index'\r\n \r\n  # The priority is based upon order of creation:\r\n  # first created -> highest priority.\r\n  #\r\n  # You can have the root of your site routed with \"root\"\r\n  # root 'welcome#index'\r\n  #\r\n  # ...\r\nThis is your application's routing file which holds entries in a special DSL (domain-specific language) that tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions. This file contains many sample routes on commented lines, and one of them actually shows you how to connect the root of your site to a specific controller and action. Find the line beginning with root and uncomment it. It should look something like the following:\r\n\r\nroot 'welcome#index'\r\nroot 'welcome#index' tells Rails to map requests to the root of the application to the welcome controller's index action and get 'welcome/index' tells Rails to map requests to http://localhost:3000/welcome/index to the welcome controller's index action. This was created earlier when you ran the controller generator (bin/rails generate controller welcome index).\r\n\r\nLaunch the web server again if you stopped it to generate the controller (bin/rails\r\nserver) and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You'll see the \"Hello, Rails!\" message you put into app/views/welcome/index.html.erb, indicating that this new route is indeed going to WelcomeController's index action and is rendering the view correctly.\r\n\r\nFor more information about routing, refer to Rails Routing from the Outside In.\r\n\r\n5 Getting Up and Running\r\nNow that you've seen how to create a controller, an action and a view, let's create something with a bit more substance.\r\n\r\nIn the Blog application, you will now create a new resource. A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people or animals. You can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.\r\n\r\nRails provides a resources method which can be used to declare a standard REST resource. You need to add the article resource to the config/routes.rb as follows:\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n \r\n  resources :articles\r\n \r\n  root 'welcome#index'\r\nend\r\nIf you run bin/rake routes, you'll see that it has defined routes for all the standard RESTful actions. The meaning of the prefix column (and other columns) will be seen later, but for now notice that Rails has inferred the singular form article and makes meaningful use of the distinction.\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake routes\r\n      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action\r\n    articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\n             POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create\r\n new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new\r\nedit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit\r\n     article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\n             PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\n        root GET    /                            welcome#index\r\nIn the next section, you will add the ability to create new articles in your application and be able to view them. This is the \"C\" and the \"R\" from CRUD: creation and reading. The form for doing this will look like this:\r\n\r\nThe new article form\r\n\r\nIt will look a little basic for now, but that's ok. We'll look at improving the styling for it afterwards.\r\n\r\n5.1 Laying down the ground work\r\nFirstly, you need a place within the application to create a new article. A great place for that would be at /articles/new. With the route already defined, requests can now be made to /articles/new in the application. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/articles/new and you'll see a routing error:\r\n\r\nAnother routing error, uninitialized constant ArticlesController\r\n\r\nThis error occurs because the route needs to have a controller defined in order to serve the request. The solution to this particular problem is simple: create a controller called ArticlesController. You can do this by running this command:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller articles\r\nIf you open up the newly generated app/controllers/articles_controller.rb you'll see a fairly empty controller:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\nend\r\nA controller is simply a class that is defined to inherit from ApplicationController. It's inside this class that you'll define methods that will become the actions for this controller. These actions will perform CRUD operations on the articles within our system.\r\n\r\nThere are public, private and protected methods in Ruby,\r\nbut only public methods can be actions for controllers.\r\nFor more details check out Programming Ruby.\r\n\r\nIf you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new now, you'll get a new error:\r\n\r\nUnknown action new for ArticlesController!\r\n\r\nThis error indicates that Rails cannot find the new action inside the ArticlesController that you just generated. This is because when controllers are generated in Rails they are empty by default, unless you tell it your wanted actions during the generation process.\r\n\r\nTo manually define an action inside a controller, all you need to do is to define a new method inside the controller. Open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and inside the ArticlesController class, define a new method so that the controller now looks like this:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nWith the new method defined in ArticlesController, if you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll see another error:\r\n\r\nTemplate is missing for articles/new\r\n\r\nYou're getting this error now because Rails expects plain actions like this one to have views associated with them to display their information. With no view available, Rails errors out.\r\n\r\nIn the above image, the bottom line has been truncated. Let's see what the full thing looks like:\r\n\r\nMissing template articles/new, application/new with {locale:[:en], formats:[:html], handlers:[:erb, :builder, :coffee]}. Searched in: * \"/path/to/blog/app/views\"\r\n\r\nThat's quite a lot of text! Let's quickly go through and understand what each part of it does.\r\n\r\nThe first part identifies what template is missing. In this case, it's the articles/new template. Rails will first look for this template. If not found, then it will attempt to load a template called application/new. It looks for one here because the ArticlesController inherits from ApplicationController.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the message contains a hash. The :locale key in this hash simply indicates what spoken language template should be retrieved. By default, this is the English - or \"en\" - template. The next key, :formats specifies the format of template to be served in response. The default format is :html, and so Rails is looking for an HTML template. The final key, :handlers, is telling us what template handlers could be used to render our template. :erb is most commonly used for HTML templates, :builder is used for XML templates, and :coffee uses CoffeeScript to build JavaScript templates.\r\n\r\nThe final part of this message tells us where Rails has looked for the templates. Templates within a basic Rails application like this are kept in a single location, but in more complex applications it could be many different paths.\r\n\r\nThe simplest template that would work in this case would be one located at app/views/articles/new.html.erb. The extension of this file name is key: the first extension is the format of the template, and the second extension is the handler that will be used. Rails is attempting to find a template called articles/new within app/views for the application. The format for this template can only be html and the handler must be one of erb, builder or coffee. Because you want to create a new HTML form, you will be using the ERB language. Therefore the file should be called articles/new.html.erb and needs to be located inside the app/views directory of the application.\r\n\r\nGo ahead now and create a new file at app/views/articles/new.html.erb and write this content in it:\r\n\r\n<h1>New Article</h1>\r\nWhen you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll now see that the page has a title. The route, controller, action and view are now working harmoniously! It's time to create the form for a new article.\r\n\r\n5.2 The first form\r\nTo create a form within this template, you will use a form builder. The primary form builder for Rails is provided by a helper method called form_for. To use this method, add this code into app/views/articles/new.html.erb:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\nIf you refresh the page now, you'll see the exact same form as in the example. Building forms in Rails is really just that easy!\r\n\r\nWhen you call form_for, you pass it an identifying object for this form. In this case, it's the symbol :article. This tells the form_for helper what this form is for. Inside the block for this method, the FormBuilder object - represented by f - is used to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article. Finally, a call to submit on the f object will create a submit button for the form.\r\n\r\nThere's one problem with this form though. If you inspect the HTML that is generated, by viewing the source of the page, you will see that the action attribute for the form is pointing at /articles/new. This is a problem because this route goes to the very page that you're on right at the moment, and that route should only be used to display the form for a new article.\r\n\r\nThe form needs to use a different URL in order to go somewhere else. This can be done quite simply with the :url option of form_for. Typically in Rails, the action that is used for new form submissions like this is called \"create\", and so the form should be pointed to that action.\r\n\r\nEdit the form_for line inside app/views/articles/new.html.erb to look like this:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\nIn this example, the articles_path helper is passed to the :url option. To see what Rails will do with this, we look back at the output of bin/rake routes:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake routes\r\n      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action\r\n    articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\n             POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create\r\n new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new\r\nedit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit\r\n     article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\n             PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\n        root GET    /                            welcome#index\r\nThe articles_path helper tells Rails to point the form to the URI Pattern associated with the articles prefix; and the form will (by default) send a POST request to that route. This is associated with the create action of the current controller, the ArticlesController.\r\n\r\nWith the form and its associated route defined, you will be able to fill in the form and then click the submit button to begin the process of creating a new article, so go ahead and do that. When you submit the form, you should see a familiar error:\r\n\r\nUnknown action create for ArticlesController\r\n\r\nYou now need to create the create action within the ArticlesController for this to work.\r\n\r\n5.3 Creating articles\r\nTo make the \"Unknown action\" go away, you can define a create action within the ArticlesController class in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb, underneath the new action, as shown:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nIf you re-submit the form now, you'll see another familiar error: a template is missing. That's ok, we can ignore that for now. What the create action should be doing is saving our new article to the database.\r\n\r\nWhen a form is submitted, the fields of the form are sent to Rails as parameters. These parameters can then be referenced inside the controller actions, typically to perform a particular task. To see what these parameters look like, change the create action to this:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  render plain: params[:article].inspect\r\nend\r\nThe render method here is taking a very simple hash with a key of plain and value of params[:article].inspect. The params method is the object which represents the parameters (or fields) coming in from the form. The params method returns an ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess object, which allows you to access the keys of the hash using either strings or symbols. In this situation, the only parameters that matter are the ones from the form.\r\n\r\nEnsure you have a firm grasp of the params method, as you'll use it fairly regularly. Let's consider an example URL: http://www.example.com/?username=dhh&email=dhh@email.com. In this URL, params[:username] would equal \"dhh\" and params[:email] would equal \"dhh@email.com\".\r\n\r\nIf you re-submit the form one more time you'll now no longer get the missing template error. Instead, you'll see something that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n{\"title\"=>\"First article!\", \"text\"=>\"This is my first article.\"}\r\nThis action is now displaying the parameters for the article that are coming in from the form. However, this isn't really all that helpful. Yes, you can see the parameters but nothing in particular is being done with them.\r\n\r\n5.4 Creating the Article model\r\nModels in Rails use a singular name, and their corresponding database tables use a plural name. Rails provides a generator for creating models, which most Rails developers tend to use when creating new models. To create the new model, run this command in your terminal:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text\r\nWith that command we told Rails that we want a Article model, together with a title attribute of type string, and a text attribute of type text. Those attributes are automatically added to the articles table in the database and mapped to the Article model.\r\n\r\nRails responded by creating a bunch of files. For now, we're only interested in app/models/article.rb and db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb (your name could be a bit different). The latter is responsible for creating the database structure, which is what we'll look at next.\r\n\r\nActive Record is smart enough to automatically map column names to model attributes, which means you don't have to declare attributes inside Rails models, as that will be done automatically by Active Record.\r\n\r\n5.5 Running a Migration\r\nAs we've just seen, bin/rails generate model created a database migration file inside the db/migrate directory. Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables. Rails uses rake commands to run migrations, and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been applied to your database. Migration filenames include a timestamp to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.\r\n\r\nIf you look in the db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb file (remember, yours will have a slightly different name), here's what you'll find:\r\n\r\nclass CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :articles do |t|\r\n      t.string :title\r\n      t.text :text\r\n \r\n      t.timestamps null: false\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe above migration creates a method named change which will be called when you run this migration. The action defined in this method is also reversible, which means Rails knows how to reverse the change made by this migration, in case you want to reverse it later. When you run this migration it will create an articles table with one string column and a text column. It also creates two timestamp fields to allow Rails to track article creation and update times.\r\n\r\nFor more information about migrations, refer to Rails Database Migrations.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can use a rake command to run the migration:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\nRails will execute this migration command and tell you it created the Articles table.\r\n\r\n==  CreateArticles: migrating ==================================================\r\n-- create_table(:articles)\r\n   -> 0.0019s\r\n==  CreateArticles: migrated (0.0020s) =========================================\r\nBecause you're working in the development environment by default, this\r\ncommand will apply to the database defined in the development section of your\r\nconfig/database.yml file. If you would like to execute migrations in another\r\nenvironment, for instance in production, you must explicitly pass it when\r\ninvoking the command: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production.\r\n\r\n5.6 Saving data in the controller\r\nBack in ArticlesController, we need to change the create action to use the new Article model to save the data in the database. Open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and change the create action to look like this:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(params[:article])\r\n \r\n  @article.save\r\n  redirect_to @article\r\nend\r\nHere's what's going on: every Rails model can be initialized with its respective attributes, which are automatically mapped to the respective database columns. In the first line we do just that (remember that params[:article] contains the attributes we're interested in). Then, @article.save is responsible for saving the model in the database. Finally, we redirect the user to the show action, which we'll define later.\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering why the A in Article.new is capitalized above, whereas most other references to articles in this guide have used lowercase. In this context, we are referring to the class named Article that is defined in \\models\\article.rb. Class names in Ruby must begin with a capital letter.\r\n\r\nAs we'll see later, @article.save returns a boolean indicating whether the article was saved or not.\r\n\r\nIf you now go to http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll almost be able to create an article. Try it! You should get an error that looks like this:\r\n\r\nForbidden attributes for new article\r\n\r\nRails has several security features that help you write secure applications, and you're running into one of them now. This one is called strong parameters, which requires us to tell Rails exactly which parameters are allowed into our controller actions.\r\n\r\nWhy do you have to bother? The ability to grab and automatically assign all controller parameters to your model in one shot makes the programmer's job easier, but this convenience also allows malicious use. What if a request to the server was crafted to look like a new article form submit but also included extra fields with values that violated your applications integrity? They would be 'mass assigned' into your model and then into the database along with the good stuff - potentially breaking your application or worse.\r\n\r\nWe have to whitelist our controller parameters to prevent wrongful mass assignment. In this case, we want to both allow and require the title and text parameters for valid use of create. The syntax for this introduces require and permit. The change will involve one line in the create action:\r\n\r\n@article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text))\r\nThis is often factored out into its own method so it can be reused by multiple actions in the same controller, for example create and update. Above and beyond mass assignment issues, the method is often made private to make sure it can't be called outside its intended context. Here is the result:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  @article.save\r\n  redirect_to @article\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nFor more information, refer to the reference above and this blog article about Strong Parameters.\r\n\r\n5.7 Showing Articles\r\nIf you submit the form again now, Rails will complain about not finding the show action. That's not very useful though, so let's add the show action before proceeding.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the output of bin/rake routes, the route for show action is as follows:\r\n\r\narticle GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\nThe special syntax :id tells rails that this route expects an :id parameter, which in our case will be the id of the article.\r\n\r\nAs we did before, we need to add the show action in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and its respective view.\r\n\r\nA frequent practice is to place the standard CRUD actions in each\r\ncontroller in the following order: index, show, new, edit, create, update\r\nand destroy. You may use any order you choose, but keep in mind that these\r\nare public methods; as mentioned earlier in this guide, they must be placed\r\nbefore any private or protected method in the controller in order to work.\r\n\r\nGiven that, let's add the show action, as follows:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nA couple of things to note. We use Article.find to find the article we're interested in, passing in params[:id] to get the :id parameter from the request. We also use an instance variable (prefixed with @) to hold a reference to the article object. We do this because Rails will pass all instance variables to the view.\r\n\r\nNow, create a new file app/views/articles/show.html.erb with the following content:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\nWith this change, you should finally be able to create new articles. Visit http://localhost:3000/articles/new and give it a try!\r\n\r\nShow action for articles\r\n\r\n5.8 Listing all articles\r\nWe still need a way to list all our articles, so let's do that. The route for this as per output of bin/rake routes is:\r\n\r\narticles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\nAdd the corresponding index action for that route inside the ArticlesController in the app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file. When we write an index action, the usual practice is to place it as the first method in the controller. Let's do it:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nAnd then finally, add the view for this action, located at app/views/articles/index.html.erb:\r\n\r\n<h1>Listing articles</h1>\r\n \r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nNow if you go to http://localhost:3000/articles you will see a list of all the articles that you have created.\r\n\r\n5.9 Adding links\r\nYou can now create, show, and list articles. Now let's add some links to navigate through pages.\r\n\r\nOpen app/views/welcome/index.html.erb and modify it as follows:\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>\r\n<%= link_to 'My Blog', controller: 'articles' %>\r\nThe link_to method is one of Rails' built-in view helpers. It creates a hyperlink based on text to display and where to go - in this case, to the path for articles.\r\n\r\nLet's add links to the other views as well, starting with adding this \"New Article\" link to app/views/articles/index.html.erb, placing it above the <table> tag:\r\n\r\n<%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %>\r\nThis link will allow you to bring up the form that lets you create a new article.\r\n\r\nNow, add another link in app/views/articles/new.html.erb, underneath the form, to go back to the index action:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\n  ...\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nFinally, add a link to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template to go back to the index action as well, so that people who are viewing a single article can go back and view the whole list again:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nIf you want to link to an action in the same controller, you don't need to specify the :controller option, as Rails will use the current controller by default.\r\n\r\nIn development mode (which is what you're working in by default), Rails reloads your application with every browser request, so there's no need to stop and restart the web server when a change is made.\r\n\r\n5.10 Adding Some Validation\r\nThe model file, app/models/article.rb is about as simple as it can get:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\nend\r\nThere isn't much to this file - but note that the Article class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. Active Record supplies a great deal of functionality to your Rails models for free, including basic database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations, data validation, as well as sophisticated search support and the ability to relate multiple models to one another.\r\n\r\nRails includes methods to help you validate the data that you send to models. Open the app/models/article.rb file and edit it:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\nThese changes will ensure that all articles have a title that is at least five characters long. Rails can validate a variety of conditions in a model, including the presence or uniqueness of columns, their format, and the existence of associated objects. Validations are covered in detail in Active Record Validations.\r\n\r\nWith the validation now in place, when you call @article.save on an invalid article, it will return false. If you open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb again, you'll notice that we don't check the result of calling @article.save inside the create action. If @article.save fails in this situation, we need to show the form back to the user. To do this, change the new and create actions inside app/controllers/articles_controller.rb to these:\r\n\r\ndef new\r\n  @article = Article.new\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nThe new action is now creating a new instance variable called @article, and you'll see why that is in just a few moments.\r\n\r\nNotice that inside the create action we use render instead of redirect_to when save returns false. The render method is used so that the @article object is passed back to the new template when it is rendered. This rendering is done within the same request as the form submission, whereas the redirect_to will tell the browser to issue another request.\r\n\r\nIf you reload http://localhost:3000/articles/new and try to save an article without a title, Rails will send you back to the form, but that's not very useful. You need to tell the user that something went wrong. To do that, you'll modify app/views/articles/new.html.erb to check for error messages:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nA few things are going on. We check if there are any errors with @article.errors.any?, and in that case we show a list of all errors with @article.errors.full_messages.\r\n\r\npluralize is a rails helper that takes a number and a string as its arguments. If the number is greater than one, the string will be automatically pluralized.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we added @article = Article.new in the ArticlesController is that otherwise @article would be nil in our view, and calling @article.errors.any? would throw an error.\r\n\r\nRails automatically wraps fields that contain an error with a div with class field_with_errors. You can define a css rule to make them standout.\r\n\r\nNow you'll get a nice error message when saving an article without title when you attempt to do just that on the new article form http://localhost:3000/articles/new:\r\n\r\nForm With Errors\r\n\r\n5.11 Updating Articles\r\nWe've covered the \"CR\" part of CRUD. Now let's focus on the \"U\" part, updating articles.\r\n\r\nThe first step we'll take is adding an edit action to the ArticlesController, generally between the new and create actions, as shown:\r\n\r\ndef new\r\n  @article = Article.new\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef edit\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe view will contain a form similar to the one we used when creating new articles. Create a file called app/views/articles/edit.html.erb and make it look as follows:\r\n\r\n<h1>Editing article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= form_for :article, url: article_path(@article), method: :patch do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis time we point the form to the update action, which is not defined yet but will be very soon.\r\n\r\nThe method: :patch option tells Rails that we want this form to be submitted via the PATCH HTTP method which is the HTTP method you're expected to use to update resources according to the REST protocol.\r\n\r\nThe first parameter of form_for can be an object, say, @article which would cause the helper to fill in the form with the fields of the object. Passing in a symbol (:article) with the same name as the instance variable (@article) also automagically leads to the same behavior. This is what is happening here. More details can be found in form_for documentation.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to create the update action in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb. Add it between the create action and the private method:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef update\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n \r\n  if @article.update(article_params)\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'edit'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nThe new method, update, is used when you want to update a record that already exists, and it accepts a hash containing the attributes that you want to update. As before, if there was an error updating the article we want to show the form back to the user.\r\n\r\nWe reuse the article_params method that we defined earlier for the create action.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to pass all attributes to update. For example, if you'd call @article.update(title: 'A new title') Rails would only update the title attribute, leaving all other attributes untouched.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to show a link to the edit action in the list of all the articles, so let's add that now to app/views/articles/index.html.erb to make it appear next to the \"Show\" link:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"2\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nAnd we'll also add one to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template as well, so that there's also an \"Edit\" link on an article's page. Add this at the bottom of the template:\r\n\r\n...\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nAnd here's how our app looks so far:\r\n\r\nIndex action with edit link\r\n\r\n5.12 Using partials to clean up duplication in views\r\nOur edit page looks very similar to the new page; in fact, they both share the same code for displaying the form. Let's remove this duplication by using a view partial. By convention, partial files are prefixed with an underscore.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about partials in the Layouts and Rendering in Rails guide.\r\n\r\nCreate a new file app/views/articles/_form.html.erb with the following content:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for @article do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\nEverything except for the form_for declaration remained the same. The reason we can use this shorter, simpler form_for declaration to stand in for either of the other forms is that @article is a resource corresponding to a full set of RESTful routes, and Rails is able to infer which URI and method to use. For more information about this use of form_for, see Resource-oriented style.\r\n\r\nNow, let's update the app/views/articles/new.html.erb view to use this new partial, rewriting it completely:\r\n\r\n<h1>New article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= render 'form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThen do the same for the app/views/articles/edit.html.erb view:\r\n\r\n<h1>Edit article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= render 'form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\n5.13 Deleting Articles\r\nWe're now ready to cover the \"D\" part of CRUD, deleting articles from the database. Following the REST convention, the route for deleting articles as per output of bin/rake routes is:\r\n\r\nDELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\nThe delete routing method should be used for routes that destroy resources. If this was left as a typical get route, it could be possible for people to craft malicious URLs like this:\r\n\r\n<a href='http://example.com/articles/1/destroy'>look at this cat!</a>\r\nWe use the delete method for destroying resources, and this route is mapped to the destroy action inside app/controllers/articles_controller.rb, which doesn't exist yet. The destroy method is generally the last CRUD action in the controller, and like the other public CRUD actions, it must be placed before any private or protected methods. Let's add it:\r\n\r\ndef destroy\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  @article.destroy\r\n \r\n  redirect_to articles_path\r\nend\r\nThe complete ArticlesController in the app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file should now look like this:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n    @article = Article.new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def edit\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n    if @article.save\r\n      redirect_to @article\r\n    else\r\n      render 'new'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def update\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n \r\n    if @article.update(article_params)\r\n      redirect_to @article\r\n    else\r\n      render 'edit'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def destroy\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n    @article.destroy\r\n \r\n    redirect_to articles_path\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def article_params\r\n      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nYou can call destroy on Active Record objects when you want to delete them from the database. Note that we don't need to add a view for this action since we're redirecting to the index action.\r\n\r\nFinally, add a 'Destroy' link to your index action template (app/views/articles/index.html.erb) to wrap everything together.\r\n\r\n<h1>Listing Articles</h1>\r\n<%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"3\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', article_path(article),\r\n              method: :delete,\r\n              data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nHere we're using link_to in a different way. We pass the named route as the second argument, and then the options as another argument. The :method and :'data-confirm' options are used as HTML5 attributes so that when the link is clicked, Rails will first show a confirm dialog to the user, and then submit the link with method delete. This is done via the JavaScript file jquery_ujs which is automatically included into your application's layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) when you generated the application. Without this file, the confirmation dialog box wouldn't appear.\r\n\r\nConfirm Dialog\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you can now create, show, list, update and destroy articles.\r\n\r\nIn general, Rails encourages using resources objects instead of declaring routes manually. For more information about routing, see Rails Routing from the Outside In.\r\n\r\n6 Adding a Second Model\r\nIt's time to add a second model to the application. The second model will handle comments on articles.\r\n\r\n6.1 Generating a Model\r\nWe're going to see the same generator that we used before when creating the Article model. This time we'll create a Comment model to hold reference of article comments. Run this command in your terminal:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references\r\nThis command will generate four files:\r\n\r\nFile\tPurpose\r\ndb/migrate/20140120201010_create_comments.rb\tMigration to create the comments table in your database (your name will include a different timestamp)\r\napp/models/comment.rb\tThe Comment model\r\ntest/models/comment_test.rb\tTesting harness for the comments model\r\ntest/fixtures/comments.yml\tSample comments for use in testing\r\nFirst, take a look at app/models/comment.rb:\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article\r\nend\r\nThis is very similar to the Article model that you saw earlier. The difference is the line belongs_to :article, which sets up an Active Record association. You'll learn a little about associations in the next section of this guide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the model, Rails has also made a migration to create the corresponding database table:\r\n\r\nclass CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :comments do |t|\r\n      t.string :commenter\r\n      t.text :body\r\n      t.references :article, index: true, foreign_key: true\r\n \r\n      t.timestamps null: false\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe t.references line creates an integer column called article_id, an index for it, and a foreign key constraint that points to the articles table. Go ahead and run the migration:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\nRails is smart enough to only execute the migrations that have not already been run against the current database, so in this case you will just see:\r\n\r\n==  CreateComments: migrating =================================================\r\n-- create_table(:comments)\r\n   -> 0.0115s\r\n==  CreateComments: migrated (0.0119s) ========================================\r\n6.2 Associating Models\r\nActive Record associations let you easily declare the relationship between two models. In the case of comments and articles, you could write out the relationships this way:\r\n\r\nEach comment belongs to one article.\r\nOne article can have many comments.\r\nIn fact, this is very close to the syntax that Rails uses to declare this association. You've already seen the line of code inside the Comment model (app/models/comment.rb) that makes each comment belong to an Article:\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article\r\nend\r\nYou'll need to edit app/models/article.rb to add the other side of the association:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\nThese two declarations enable a good bit of automatic behavior. For example, if you have an instance variable @article containing an article, you can retrieve all the comments belonging to that article as an array using @article.comments.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Active Record associations, see the Active Record Associations guide.\r\n\r\n6.3 Adding a Route for Comments\r\nAs with the welcome controller, we will need to add a route so that Rails knows where we would like to navigate to see comments. Open up the config/routes.rb file again, and edit it as follows:\r\n\r\nresources :articles do\r\n  resources :comments\r\nend\r\nThis creates comments as a nested resource within articles. This is another part of capturing the hierarchical relationship that exists between articles and comments.\r\n\r\nFor more information on routing, see the Rails Routing guide.\r\n\r\n6.4 Generating a Controller\r\nWith the model in hand, you can turn your attention to creating a matching controller. Again, we'll use the same generator we used before:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller Comments\r\nThis creates five files and one empty directory:\r\n\r\nFile/Directory\tPurpose\r\napp/controllers/comments_controller.rb\tThe Comments controller\r\napp/views/comments/\tViews of the controller are stored here\r\ntest/controllers/comments_controller_test.rb\tThe test for the controller\r\napp/helpers/comments_helper.rb\tA view helper file\r\napp/assets/javascripts/comment.js.coffee\tCoffeeScript for the controller\r\napp/assets/stylesheets/comment.css.scss\tCascading style sheet for the controller\r\nLike with any blog, our readers will create their comments directly after reading the article, and once they have added their comment, will be sent back to the article show page to see their comment now listed. Due to this, our CommentsController is there to provide a method to create comments and delete spam comments when they arrive.\r\n\r\nSo first, we'll wire up the Article show template (app/views/articles/show.html.erb) to let us make a new comment:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis adds a form on the Article show page that creates a new comment by calling the CommentsController create action. The form_for call here uses an array, which will build a nested route, such as /articles/1/comments.\r\n\r\nLet's wire up the create in app/controllers/comments_controller.rb:\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def comment_params\r\n      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nYou'll see a bit more complexity here than you did in the controller for articles. That's a side-effect of the nesting that you've set up. Each request for a comment has to keep track of the article to which the comment is attached, thus the initial call to the find method of the Article model to get the article in question.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the code takes advantage of some of the methods available for an association. We use the create method on @article.comments to create and save the comment. This will automatically link the comment so that it belongs to that particular article.\r\n\r\nOnce we have made the new comment, we send the user back to the original article using the article_path(@article) helper. As we have already seen, this calls the show action of the ArticlesController which in turn renders the show.html.erb template. This is where we want the comment to show, so let's add that to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<% @article.comments.each do |comment| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n    <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n    <%= comment.body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nNow you can add articles and comments to your blog and have them show up in the right places.\r\n\r\nArticle with Comments\r\n\r\n7 Refactoring\r\nNow that we have articles and comments working, take a look at the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template. It is getting long and awkward. We can use partials to clean it up.\r\n\r\n7.1 Rendering Partial Collections\r\nFirst, we will make a comment partial to extract showing all the comments for the article. Create the file app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb and put the following into it:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.body %>\r\n</p>\r\nThen you can change app/views/articles/show.html.erb to look like the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<%= render @article.comments %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis will now render the partial in app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb once for each comment that is in the @article.comments collection. As the render method iterates over the @article.comments collection, it assigns each comment to a local variable named the same as the partial, in this case comment which is then available in the partial for us to show.\r\n\r\n7.2 Rendering a Partial Form\r\nLet us also move that new comment section out to its own partial. Again, you create a file app/views/comments/_form.html.erb containing:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\nThen you make the app/views/articles/show.html.erb look like the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<%= render @article.comments %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= render 'comments/form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThe second render just defines the partial template we want to render, comments/form. Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to render the _form.html.erb file in the app/views/comments directory.\r\n\r\nThe @article object is available to any partials rendered in the view because we defined it as an instance variable.\r\n\r\n8 Deleting Comments\r\nAnother important feature of a blog is being able to delete spam comments. To do this, we need to implement a link of some sort in the view and a destroy action in the CommentsController.\r\n\r\nSo first, let's add the delete link in the app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb partial:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.body %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <%= link_to 'Destroy Comment', [comment.article, comment],\r\n               method: :delete,\r\n               data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>\r\n</p>\r\nClicking this new \"Destroy Comment\" link will fire off a DELETE\r\n/articles/:article_id/comments/:id to our CommentsController, which can then use this to find the comment we want to delete, so let's add a destroy action to our controller (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb):\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def destroy\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.find(params[:id])\r\n    @comment.destroy\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def comment_params\r\n      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nThe destroy action will find the article we are looking at, locate the comment within the @article.comments collection, and then remove it from the database and send us back to the show action for the article.\r\n\r\n8.1 Deleting Associated Objects\r\nIf you delete an article, its associated comments will also need to be deleted, otherwise they would simply occupy space in the database. Rails allows you to use the dependent option of an association to achieve this. Modify the Article model, app/models/article.rb, as follows:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\n9 Security\r\n9.1 Basic Authentication\r\nIf you were to publish your blog online, anyone would be able to add, edit and delete articles or delete comments.\r\n\r\nRails provides a very simple HTTP authentication system that will work nicely in this situation.\r\n\r\nIn the ArticlesController we need to have a way to block access to the various actions if the person is not authenticated. Here we can use the Rails http_basic_authenticate_with method, which allows access to the requested action if that method allows it.\r\n\r\nTo use the authentication system, we specify it at the top of our ArticlesController in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb. In our case, we want the user to be authenticated on every action except index and show, so we write that:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n \r\n  http_basic_authenticate_with name: \"dhh\", password: \"secret\", except: [:index, :show]\r\n \r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nWe also want to allow only authenticated users to delete comments, so in the CommentsController (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb) we write:\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n \r\n  http_basic_authenticate_with name: \"dhh\", password: \"secret\", only: :destroy\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nNow if you try to create a new article, you will be greeted with a basic HTTP Authentication challenge:\r\n\r\nBasic HTTP Authentication Challenge\r\n\r\nOther authentication methods are available for Rails applications. Two popular authentication add-ons for Rails are the Devise rails engine and the Authlogic gem, along with a number of others.\r\n\r\n9.2 Other Security Considerations\r\nSecurity, especially in web applications, is a broad and detailed area. Security in your Rails application is covered in more depth in the Ruby on Rails Security Guide.\r\n\r\n10 What's Next?\r\nNow that you've seen your first Rails application, you should feel free to update it and experiment on your own. But you don't have to do everything without help. As you need assistance getting up and running with Rails, feel free to consult these support resources:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby on Rails Guides\r\nThe Ruby on Rails Tutorial\r\nThe Ruby on Rails mailing list\r\nThe #rubyonrails channel on irc.freenode.net\r\nRails also comes with built-in help that you can generate using the rake command-line utility:\r\n\r\nRunning rake doc:guides will put a full copy of the Rails Guides in the doc/guides folder of your application. Open doc/guides/index.html in your web browser to explore the Guides.\r\nRunning rake doc:rails will put a full copy of the API documentation for Rails in the doc/api folder of your application. Open doc/api/index.html in your web browser to explore the API documentation.\r\nTo be able to generate the Rails Guides locally with the doc:guides rake task you need to install the RedCloth and Nokogiri gems. Add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install and you're ready to go.\r\n\r\n11 Configuration Gotchas\r\nThe easiest way to work with Rails is to store all external data as UTF-8. If you don't, Ruby libraries and Rails will often be able to convert your native data into UTF-8, but this doesn't always work reliably, so you're better off ensuring that all external data is UTF-8.\r\n\r\nIf you have made a mistake in this area, the most common symptom is a black diamond with a question mark inside appearing in the browser. Another common symptom is characters like \"Ã¼\" appearing instead of \"ü\". Rails takes a number of internal steps to mitigate common causes of these problems that can be automatically detected and corrected. However, if you have external data that is not stored as UTF-8, it can occasionally result in these kinds of issues that cannot be automatically detected by Rails and corrected.\r\n\r\nTwo very common sources of data that are not UTF-8:\r\n\r\nYour text editor: Most text editors (such as TextMate), default to saving files as UTF-8. If your text editor does not, this can result in special characters that you enter in your templates (such as é) to appear as a diamond with a question mark inside in the browser. This also applies to your i18n translation files. Most editors that do not already default to UTF-8 (such as some versions of Dreamweaver) offer a way to change the default to UTF-8. Do so.\r\nYour database: Rails defaults to converting data from your database into UTF-8 at the boundary. However, if your database is not using UTF-8 internally, it may not be able to store all characters that your users enter. For instance, if your database is using Latin-1 internally, and your user enters a Russian, Hebrew, or Japanese character, the data will be lost forever once it enters the database. If possible, use UTF-8 as the internal storage of your database.\r\nFeedback\r\nYou're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide.\r\n\r\nPlease contribute if you see any typos or factual errors.

It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Rails. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites installed:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby language version 1.9.3 or newer.\r\nThe RubyGems packaging system, which is installed with Ruby versions 1.9 and later. To learn more about RubyGems, please read the RubyGems Guides.\r\nA working installation of the SQLite3 Database.\r\nRails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Ruby:\r\n\r\nOfficial Ruby Programming Language website\r\nreSRC's List of Free Programming Books\r\nBe aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as 1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.\r\n\r\n2 What is Rails?\r\nRails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\r\n\r\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\r\n\r\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\r\n\r\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\r\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.\r\n3 Creating a New Rails Project\r\nThe best way to use this guide is to follow each step as it happens, no code or step needed to make this example application has been left out, so you can literally follow along step by step.\r\n\r\nBy following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called blog, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application, you need to make sure that you have Rails itself installed.\r\n\r\nThe examples below use $ to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS, though it may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows, your prompt will look something like c:\\source_code>\r\n\r\n3.1 Installing Rails\r\nOpen up a command line prompt. On Mac OS X open Terminal.app, on Windows choose \"Run\" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign $ should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a current version of Ruby installed:\r\n\r\nA number of tools exist to help you quickly install Ruby and Ruby on Rails on your system. Windows users can use Rails Installer, while Mac OS X users can use Tokaido.\r\n\r\n$ ruby -v\r\nruby 2.0.0p353\r\nIf you don't have Ruby installed have a look at ruby-lang.org for possible ways to install Ruby on your platform.\r\n\r\nMany popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3. Windows users and others can find installation instructions at the SQLite3 website. Verify that it is correctly installed and in your PATH:\r\n\r\n$ sqlite3 --version\r\nThe program should report its version.\r\n\r\nTo install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:\r\n\r\n$ gem install rails\r\nTo verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:\r\n\r\n$ rails --version\r\nIf it says something like \"Rails 4.2.1\", you are ready to continue.\r\n\r\n3.2 Creating the Blog Application\r\nRails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task. One of these is the new application generator, which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that you don't have to write it yourself.\r\n\r\nTo use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and type:\r\n\r\n$ rails new blog\r\nThis will create a Rails application called Blog in a blog directory and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in Gemfile using bundle install.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running rails new -h.\r\n\r\nAfter you create the blog application, switch to its folder:\r\n\r\n$ cd blog\r\nThe blog directory has a number of auto-generated files and folders that make up the structure of a Rails application. Most of the work in this tutorial will happen in the app folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each of the files and folders that Rails created by default:\r\n\r\nFile/Folder\tPurpose\r\napp/\tContains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.\r\nbin/\tContains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to setup, deploy or run your application.\r\nconfig/\tConfigure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in Configuring Rails Applications.\r\nconfig.ru\tRack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application.\r\ndb/\tContains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.\r\nGemfile\r\nGemfile.lock\tThese files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the Bundler website.\r\nlib/\tExtended modules for your application.\r\nlog/\tApplication log files.\r\npublic/\tThe only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.\r\nRakefile\tThis file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application.\r\nREADME.rdoc\tThis is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.\r\ntest/\tUnit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in Testing Rails Applications.\r\ntmp/\tTemporary files (like cache, pid, and session files).\r\nvendor/\tA place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.\r\n4 Hello, Rails!\r\nTo begin with, let's get some text up on screen quickly. To do this, you need to get your Rails application server running.\r\n\r\n4.1 Starting up the Web Server\r\nYou actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the following in the blog directory:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails server\r\nIf you are using Windows, you have to pass the scripts under the bin folder directly to the Ruby interpreter e.g. ruby bin\\rails server.\r\n\r\nCompiling CoffeeScript and JavaScript asset compression requires you have a JavaScript runtime available on your system, in the absence of a runtime you will see an execjs error during asset compilation. Usually Mac OS X and Windows come with a JavaScript runtime installed. Rails adds the therubyracer gem to the generated Gemfile in a commented line for new apps and you can uncomment if you need it. therubyrhino is the recommended runtime for JRuby users and is added by default to the Gemfile in apps generated under JRuby. You can investigate all the supported runtimes at ExecJS.\r\n\r\nThis will fire up WEBrick, a web server distributed with Ruby by default. To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Rails default information page:\r\n\r\nWelcome aboard screenshot\r\n\r\nTo stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running. To verify the server has stopped you should see your command prompt cursor again. For most UNIX-like systems including Mac OS X this will be a dollar sign $. In development mode, Rails does not generally require you to restart the server; changes you make in files will be automatically picked up by the server.\r\n\r\nThe \"Welcome aboard\" page is the smoke test for a new Rails application: it makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a page. You can also click on the About your application's environment link to see a summary of your application's environment.\r\n\r\n4.2 Say \"Hello\", Rails\r\nTo get Rails saying \"Hello\", you need to create at minimum a controller and a view.\r\n\r\nA controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. Routing decides which controller receives which requests. Often, there is more than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by different actions. Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.\r\n\r\nA view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format. An important distinction to make is that it is the controller, not the view, where information is collected. The view should just display that information. By default, view templates are written in a language called eRuby (Embedded Ruby) which is processed by the request cycle in Rails before being sent to the user.\r\n\r\nTo create a new controller, you will need to run the \"controller\" generator and tell it you want a controller called \"welcome\" with an action called \"index\", just like this:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller welcome index\r\nRails will create several files and a route for you.\r\n\r\ncreate  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb\r\n route  get 'welcome/index'\r\ninvoke  erb\r\ncreate    app/views/welcome\r\ncreate    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb\r\ninvoke  test_unit\r\ncreate    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb\r\ninvoke  helper\r\ncreate    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb\r\ninvoke  assets\r\ninvoke    coffee\r\ncreate      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.js.coffee\r\ninvoke    scss\r\ncreate      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.css.scss\r\nMost important of these are of course the controller, located at app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb and the view, located at app/views/welcome/index.html.erb.\r\n\r\nOpen the app/views/welcome/index.html.erb file in your text editor. Delete all of the existing code in the file, and replace it with the following single line of code:\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>\r\n4.3 Setting the Application Home Page\r\nNow that we have made the controller and view, we need to tell Rails when we want \"Hello, Rails!\" to show up. In our case, we want it to show up when we navigate to the root URL of our site, http://localhost:3000. At the moment, \"Welcome aboard\" is occupying that spot.\r\n\r\nNext, you have to tell Rails where your actual home page is located.\r\n\r\nOpen the file config/routes.rb in your editor.\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  get 'welcome/index'\r\n \r\n  # The priority is based upon order of creation:\r\n  # first created -> highest priority.\r\n  #\r\n  # You can have the root of your site routed with \"root\"\r\n  # root 'welcome#index'\r\n  #\r\n  # ...\r\nThis is your application's routing file which holds entries in a special DSL (domain-specific language) that tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions. This file contains many sample routes on commented lines, and one of them actually shows you how to connect the root of your site to a specific controller and action. Find the line beginning with root and uncomment it. It should look something like the following:\r\n\r\nroot 'welcome#index'\r\nroot 'welcome#index' tells Rails to map requests to the root of the application to the welcome controller's index action and get 'welcome/index' tells Rails to map requests to http://localhost:3000/welcome/index to the welcome controller's index action. This was created earlier when you ran the controller generator (bin/rails generate controller welcome index).\r\n\r\nLaunch the web server again if you stopped it to generate the controller (bin/rails\r\nserver) and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You'll see the \"Hello, Rails!\" message you put into app/views/welcome/index.html.erb, indicating that this new route is indeed going to WelcomeController's index action and is rendering the view correctly.\r\n\r\nFor more information about routing, refer to Rails Routing from the Outside In.\r\n\r\n5 Getting Up and Running\r\nNow that you've seen how to create a controller, an action and a view, let's create something with a bit more substance.\r\n\r\nIn the Blog application, you will now create a new resource. A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people or animals. You can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.\r\n\r\nRails provides a resources method which can be used to declare a standard REST resource. You need to add the article resource to the config/routes.rb as follows:\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n \r\n  resources :articles\r\n \r\n  root 'welcome#index'\r\nend\r\nIf you run bin/rake routes, you'll see that it has defined routes for all the standard RESTful actions. The meaning of the prefix column (and other columns) will be seen later, but for now notice that Rails has inferred the singular form article and makes meaningful use of the distinction.\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake routes\r\n      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action\r\n    articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\n             POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create\r\n new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new\r\nedit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit\r\n     article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\n             PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\n        root GET    /                            welcome#index\r\nIn the next section, you will add the ability to create new articles in your application and be able to view them. This is the \"C\" and the \"R\" from CRUD: creation and reading. The form for doing this will look like this:\r\n\r\nThe new article form\r\n\r\nIt will look a little basic for now, but that's ok. We'll look at improving the styling for it afterwards.\r\n\r\n5.1 Laying down the ground work\r\nFirstly, you need a place within the application to create a new article. A great place for that would be at /articles/new. With the route already defined, requests can now be made to /articles/new in the application. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/articles/new and you'll see a routing error:\r\n\r\nAnother routing error, uninitialized constant ArticlesController\r\n\r\nThis error occurs because the route needs to have a controller defined in order to serve the request. The solution to this particular problem is simple: create a controller called ArticlesController. You can do this by running this command:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller articles\r\nIf you open up the newly generated app/controllers/articles_controller.rb you'll see a fairly empty controller:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\nend\r\nA controller is simply a class that is defined to inherit from ApplicationController. It's inside this class that you'll define methods that will become the actions for this controller. These actions will perform CRUD operations on the articles within our system.\r\n\r\nThere are public, private and protected methods in Ruby,\r\nbut only public methods can be actions for controllers.\r\nFor more details check out Programming Ruby.\r\n\r\nIf you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new now, you'll get a new error:\r\n\r\nUnknown action new for ArticlesController!\r\n\r\nThis error indicates that Rails cannot find the new action inside the ArticlesController that you just generated. This is because when controllers are generated in Rails they are empty by default, unless you tell it your wanted actions during the generation process.\r\n\r\nTo manually define an action inside a controller, all you need to do is to define a new method inside the controller. Open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and inside the ArticlesController class, define a new method so that the controller now looks like this:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nWith the new method defined in ArticlesController, if you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll see another error:\r\n\r\nTemplate is missing for articles/new\r\n\r\nYou're getting this error now because Rails expects plain actions like this one to have views associated with them to display their information. With no view available, Rails errors out.\r\n\r\nIn the above image, the bottom line has been truncated. Let's see what the full thing looks like:\r\n\r\nMissing template articles/new, application/new with {locale:[:en], formats:[:html], handlers:[:erb, :builder, :coffee]}. Searched in: * \"/path/to/blog/app/views\"\r\n\r\nThat's quite a lot of text! Let's quickly go through and understand what each part of it does.\r\n\r\nThe first part identifies what template is missing. In this case, it's the articles/new template. Rails will first look for this template. If not found, then it will attempt to load a template called application/new. It looks for one here because the ArticlesController inherits from ApplicationController.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the message contains a hash. The :locale key in this hash simply indicates what spoken language template should be retrieved. By default, this is the English - or \"en\" - template. The next key, :formats specifies the format of template to be served in response. The default format is :html, and so Rails is looking for an HTML template. The final key, :handlers, is telling us what template handlers could be used to render our template. :erb is most commonly used for HTML templates, :builder is used for XML templates, and :coffee uses CoffeeScript to build JavaScript templates.\r\n\r\nThe final part of this message tells us where Rails has looked for the templates. Templates within a basic Rails application like this are kept in a single location, but in more complex applications it could be many different paths.\r\n\r\nThe simplest template that would work in this case would be one located at app/views/articles/new.html.erb. The extension of this file name is key: the first extension is the format of the template, and the second extension is the handler that will be used. Rails is attempting to find a template called articles/new within app/views for the application. The format for this template can only be html and the handler must be one of erb, builder or coffee. Because you want to create a new HTML form, you will be using the ERB language. Therefore the file should be called articles/new.html.erb and needs to be located inside the app/views directory of the application.\r\n\r\nGo ahead now and create a new file at app/views/articles/new.html.erb and write this content in it:\r\n\r\n<h1>New Article</h1>\r\nWhen you refresh http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll now see that the page has a title. The route, controller, action and view are now working harmoniously! It's time to create the form for a new article.\r\n\r\n5.2 The first form\r\nTo create a form within this template, you will use a form builder. The primary form builder for Rails is provided by a helper method called form_for. To use this method, add this code into app/views/articles/new.html.erb:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\nIf you refresh the page now, you'll see the exact same form as in the example. Building forms in Rails is really just that easy!\r\n\r\nWhen you call form_for, you pass it an identifying object for this form. In this case, it's the symbol :article. This tells the form_for helper what this form is for. Inside the block for this method, the FormBuilder object - represented by f - is used to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article. Finally, a call to submit on the f object will create a submit button for the form.\r\n\r\nThere's one problem with this form though. If you inspect the HTML that is generated, by viewing the source of the page, you will see that the action attribute for the form is pointing at /articles/new. This is a problem because this route goes to the very page that you're on right at the moment, and that route should only be used to display the form for a new article.\r\n\r\nThe form needs to use a different URL in order to go somewhere else. This can be done quite simply with the :url option of form_for. Typically in Rails, the action that is used for new form submissions like this is called \"create\", and so the form should be pointed to that action.\r\n\r\nEdit the form_for line inside app/views/articles/new.html.erb to look like this:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\nIn this example, the articles_path helper is passed to the :url option. To see what Rails will do with this, we look back at the output of bin/rake routes:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake routes\r\n      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action\r\n    articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\n             POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create\r\n new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new\r\nedit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit\r\n     article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\n             PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update\r\n             DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\n        root GET    /                            welcome#index\r\nThe articles_path helper tells Rails to point the form to the URI Pattern associated with the articles prefix; and the form will (by default) send a POST request to that route. This is associated with the create action of the current controller, the ArticlesController.\r\n\r\nWith the form and its associated route defined, you will be able to fill in the form and then click the submit button to begin the process of creating a new article, so go ahead and do that. When you submit the form, you should see a familiar error:\r\n\r\nUnknown action create for ArticlesController\r\n\r\nYou now need to create the create action within the ArticlesController for this to work.\r\n\r\n5.3 Creating articles\r\nTo make the \"Unknown action\" go away, you can define a create action within the ArticlesController class in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb, underneath the new action, as shown:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nIf you re-submit the form now, you'll see another familiar error: a template is missing. That's ok, we can ignore that for now. What the create action should be doing is saving our new article to the database.\r\n\r\nWhen a form is submitted, the fields of the form are sent to Rails as parameters. These parameters can then be referenced inside the controller actions, typically to perform a particular task. To see what these parameters look like, change the create action to this:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  render plain: params[:article].inspect\r\nend\r\nThe render method here is taking a very simple hash with a key of plain and value of params[:article].inspect. The params method is the object which represents the parameters (or fields) coming in from the form. The params method returns an ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess object, which allows you to access the keys of the hash using either strings or symbols. In this situation, the only parameters that matter are the ones from the form.\r\n\r\nEnsure you have a firm grasp of the params method, as you'll use it fairly regularly. Let's consider an example URL: http://www.example.com/?username=dhh&email=dhh@email.com. In this URL, params[:username] would equal \"dhh\" and params[:email] would equal \"dhh@email.com\".\r\n\r\nIf you re-submit the form one more time you'll now no longer get the missing template error. Instead, you'll see something that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n{\"title\"=>\"First article!\", \"text\"=>\"This is my first article.\"}\r\nThis action is now displaying the parameters for the article that are coming in from the form. However, this isn't really all that helpful. Yes, you can see the parameters but nothing in particular is being done with them.\r\n\r\n5.4 Creating the Article model\r\nModels in Rails use a singular name, and their corresponding database tables use a plural name. Rails provides a generator for creating models, which most Rails developers tend to use when creating new models. To create the new model, run this command in your terminal:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text\r\nWith that command we told Rails that we want a Article model, together with a title attribute of type string, and a text attribute of type text. Those attributes are automatically added to the articles table in the database and mapped to the Article model.\r\n\r\nRails responded by creating a bunch of files. For now, we're only interested in app/models/article.rb and db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb (your name could be a bit different). The latter is responsible for creating the database structure, which is what we'll look at next.\r\n\r\nActive Record is smart enough to automatically map column names to model attributes, which means you don't have to declare attributes inside Rails models, as that will be done automatically by Active Record.\r\n\r\n5.5 Running a Migration\r\nAs we've just seen, bin/rails generate model created a database migration file inside the db/migrate directory. Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables. Rails uses rake commands to run migrations, and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been applied to your database. Migration filenames include a timestamp to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.\r\n\r\nIf you look in the db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb file (remember, yours will have a slightly different name), here's what you'll find:\r\n\r\nclass CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :articles do |t|\r\n      t.string :title\r\n      t.text :text\r\n \r\n      t.timestamps null: false\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe above migration creates a method named change which will be called when you run this migration. The action defined in this method is also reversible, which means Rails knows how to reverse the change made by this migration, in case you want to reverse it later. When you run this migration it will create an articles table with one string column and a text column. It also creates two timestamp fields to allow Rails to track article creation and update times.\r\n\r\nFor more information about migrations, refer to Rails Database Migrations.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can use a rake command to run the migration:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\nRails will execute this migration command and tell you it created the Articles table.\r\n\r\n==  CreateArticles: migrating ==================================================\r\n-- create_table(:articles)\r\n   -> 0.0019s\r\n==  CreateArticles: migrated (0.0020s) =========================================\r\nBecause you're working in the development environment by default, this\r\ncommand will apply to the database defined in the development section of your\r\nconfig/database.yml file. If you would like to execute migrations in another\r\nenvironment, for instance in production, you must explicitly pass it when\r\ninvoking the command: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production.\r\n\r\n5.6 Saving data in the controller\r\nBack in ArticlesController, we need to change the create action to use the new Article model to save the data in the database. Open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and change the create action to look like this:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(params[:article])\r\n \r\n  @article.save\r\n  redirect_to @article\r\nend\r\nHere's what's going on: every Rails model can be initialized with its respective attributes, which are automatically mapped to the respective database columns. In the first line we do just that (remember that params[:article] contains the attributes we're interested in). Then, @article.save is responsible for saving the model in the database. Finally, we redirect the user to the show action, which we'll define later.\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering why the A in Article.new is capitalized above, whereas most other references to articles in this guide have used lowercase. In this context, we are referring to the class named Article that is defined in \\models\\article.rb. Class names in Ruby must begin with a capital letter.\r\n\r\nAs we'll see later, @article.save returns a boolean indicating whether the article was saved or not.\r\n\r\nIf you now go to http://localhost:3000/articles/new you'll almost be able to create an article. Try it! You should get an error that looks like this:\r\n\r\nForbidden attributes for new article\r\n\r\nRails has several security features that help you write secure applications, and you're running into one of them now. This one is called strong parameters, which requires us to tell Rails exactly which parameters are allowed into our controller actions.\r\n\r\nWhy do you have to bother? The ability to grab and automatically assign all controller parameters to your model in one shot makes the programmer's job easier, but this convenience also allows malicious use. What if a request to the server was crafted to look like a new article form submit but also included extra fields with values that violated your applications integrity? They would be 'mass assigned' into your model and then into the database along with the good stuff - potentially breaking your application or worse.\r\n\r\nWe have to whitelist our controller parameters to prevent wrongful mass assignment. In this case, we want to both allow and require the title and text parameters for valid use of create. The syntax for this introduces require and permit. The change will involve one line in the create action:\r\n\r\n@article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text))\r\nThis is often factored out into its own method so it can be reused by multiple actions in the same controller, for example create and update. Above and beyond mass assignment issues, the method is often made private to make sure it can't be called outside its intended context. Here is the result:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  @article.save\r\n  redirect_to @article\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nFor more information, refer to the reference above and this blog article about Strong Parameters.\r\n\r\n5.7 Showing Articles\r\nIf you submit the form again now, Rails will complain about not finding the show action. That's not very useful though, so let's add the show action before proceeding.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the output of bin/rake routes, the route for show action is as follows:\r\n\r\narticle GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show\r\nThe special syntax :id tells rails that this route expects an :id parameter, which in our case will be the id of the article.\r\n\r\nAs we did before, we need to add the show action in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and its respective view.\r\n\r\nA frequent practice is to place the standard CRUD actions in each\r\ncontroller in the following order: index, show, new, edit, create, update\r\nand destroy. You may use any order you choose, but keep in mind that these\r\nare public methods; as mentioned earlier in this guide, they must be placed\r\nbefore any private or protected method in the controller in order to work.\r\n\r\nGiven that, let's add the show action, as follows:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nA couple of things to note. We use Article.find to find the article we're interested in, passing in params[:id] to get the :id parameter from the request. We also use an instance variable (prefixed with @) to hold a reference to the article object. We do this because Rails will pass all instance variables to the view.\r\n\r\nNow, create a new file app/views/articles/show.html.erb with the following content:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\nWith this change, you should finally be able to create new articles. Visit http://localhost:3000/articles/new and give it a try!\r\n\r\nShow action for articles\r\n\r\n5.8 Listing all articles\r\nWe still need a way to list all our articles, so let's do that. The route for this as per output of bin/rake routes is:\r\n\r\narticles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index\r\nAdd the corresponding index action for that route inside the ArticlesController in the app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file. When we write an index action, the usual practice is to place it as the first method in the controller. Let's do it:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nAnd then finally, add the view for this action, located at app/views/articles/index.html.erb:\r\n\r\n<h1>Listing articles</h1>\r\n \r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nNow if you go to http://localhost:3000/articles you will see a list of all the articles that you have created.\r\n\r\n5.9 Adding links\r\nYou can now create, show, and list articles. Now let's add some links to navigate through pages.\r\n\r\nOpen app/views/welcome/index.html.erb and modify it as follows:\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>\r\n<%= link_to 'My Blog', controller: 'articles' %>\r\nThe link_to method is one of Rails' built-in view helpers. It creates a hyperlink based on text to display and where to go - in this case, to the path for articles.\r\n\r\nLet's add links to the other views as well, starting with adding this \"New Article\" link to app/views/articles/index.html.erb, placing it above the <table> tag:\r\n\r\n<%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %>\r\nThis link will allow you to bring up the form that lets you create a new article.\r\n\r\nNow, add another link in app/views/articles/new.html.erb, underneath the form, to go back to the index action:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\n  ...\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nFinally, add a link to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template to go back to the index action as well, so that people who are viewing a single article can go back and view the whole list again:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nIf you want to link to an action in the same controller, you don't need to specify the :controller option, as Rails will use the current controller by default.\r\n\r\nIn development mode (which is what you're working in by default), Rails reloads your application with every browser request, so there's no need to stop and restart the web server when a change is made.\r\n\r\n5.10 Adding Some Validation\r\nThe model file, app/models/article.rb is about as simple as it can get:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\nend\r\nThere isn't much to this file - but note that the Article class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. Active Record supplies a great deal of functionality to your Rails models for free, including basic database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations, data validation, as well as sophisticated search support and the ability to relate multiple models to one another.\r\n\r\nRails includes methods to help you validate the data that you send to models. Open the app/models/article.rb file and edit it:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\nThese changes will ensure that all articles have a title that is at least five characters long. Rails can validate a variety of conditions in a model, including the presence or uniqueness of columns, their format, and the existence of associated objects. Validations are covered in detail in Active Record Validations.\r\n\r\nWith the validation now in place, when you call @article.save on an invalid article, it will return false. If you open app/controllers/articles_controller.rb again, you'll notice that we don't check the result of calling @article.save inside the create action. If @article.save fails in this situation, we need to show the form back to the user. To do this, change the new and create actions inside app/controllers/articles_controller.rb to these:\r\n\r\ndef new\r\n  @article = Article.new\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nThe new action is now creating a new instance variable called @article, and you'll see why that is in just a few moments.\r\n\r\nNotice that inside the create action we use render instead of redirect_to when save returns false. The render method is used so that the @article object is passed back to the new template when it is rendered. This rendering is done within the same request as the form submission, whereas the redirect_to will tell the browser to issue another request.\r\n\r\nIf you reload http://localhost:3000/articles/new and try to save an article without a title, Rails will send you back to the form, but that's not very useful. You need to tell the user that something went wrong. To do that, you'll modify app/views/articles/new.html.erb to check for error messages:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nA few things are going on. We check if there are any errors with @article.errors.any?, and in that case we show a list of all errors with @article.errors.full_messages.\r\n\r\npluralize is a rails helper that takes a number and a string as its arguments. If the number is greater than one, the string will be automatically pluralized.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we added @article = Article.new in the ArticlesController is that otherwise @article would be nil in our view, and calling @article.errors.any? would throw an error.\r\n\r\nRails automatically wraps fields that contain an error with a div with class field_with_errors. You can define a css rule to make them standout.\r\n\r\nNow you'll get a nice error message when saving an article without title when you attempt to do just that on the new article form http://localhost:3000/articles/new:\r\n\r\nForm With Errors\r\n\r\n5.11 Updating Articles\r\nWe've covered the \"CR\" part of CRUD. Now let's focus on the \"U\" part, updating articles.\r\n\r\nThe first step we'll take is adding an edit action to the ArticlesController, generally between the new and create actions, as shown:\r\n\r\ndef new\r\n  @article = Article.new\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef edit\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe view will contain a form similar to the one we used when creating new articles. Create a file called app/views/articles/edit.html.erb and make it look as follows:\r\n\r\n<h1>Editing article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= form_for :article, url: article_path(@article), method: :patch do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis time we point the form to the update action, which is not defined yet but will be very soon.\r\n\r\nThe method: :patch option tells Rails that we want this form to be submitted via the PATCH HTTP method which is the HTTP method you're expected to use to update resources according to the REST protocol.\r\n\r\nThe first parameter of form_for can be an object, say, @article which would cause the helper to fill in the form with the fields of the object. Passing in a symbol (:article) with the same name as the instance variable (@article) also automagically leads to the same behavior. This is what is happening here. More details can be found in form_for documentation.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to create the update action in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb. Add it between the create action and the private method:\r\n\r\ndef create\r\n  @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n  if @article.save\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'new'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\ndef update\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n \r\n  if @article.update(article_params)\r\n    redirect_to @article\r\n  else\r\n    render 'edit'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n \r\nprivate\r\n  def article_params\r\n    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n  end\r\nThe new method, update, is used when you want to update a record that already exists, and it accepts a hash containing the attributes that you want to update. As before, if there was an error updating the article we want to show the form back to the user.\r\n\r\nWe reuse the article_params method that we defined earlier for the create action.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to pass all attributes to update. For example, if you'd call @article.update(title: 'A new title') Rails would only update the title attribute, leaving all other attributes untouched.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to show a link to the edit action in the list of all the articles, so let's add that now to app/views/articles/index.html.erb to make it appear next to the \"Show\" link:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"2\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nAnd we'll also add one to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template as well, so that there's also an \"Edit\" link on an article's page. Add this at the bottom of the template:\r\n\r\n...\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nAnd here's how our app looks so far:\r\n\r\nIndex action with edit link\r\n\r\n5.12 Using partials to clean up duplication in views\r\nOur edit page looks very similar to the new page; in fact, they both share the same code for displaying the form. Let's remove this duplication by using a view partial. By convention, partial files are prefixed with an underscore.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about partials in the Layouts and Rendering in Rails guide.\r\n\r\nCreate a new file app/views/articles/_form.html.erb with the following content:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for @article do |f| %>\r\n \r\n  <% if @article.errors.any? %>\r\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited\r\n        this article from being saved:\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>\r\n          <li><%= msg %></li>\r\n        <% end %>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :title %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :title %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :text %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :text %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<% end %>\r\nEverything except for the form_for declaration remained the same. The reason we can use this shorter, simpler form_for declaration to stand in for either of the other forms is that @article is a resource corresponding to a full set of RESTful routes, and Rails is able to infer which URI and method to use. For more information about this use of form_for, see Resource-oriented style.\r\n\r\nNow, let's update the app/views/articles/new.html.erb view to use this new partial, rewriting it completely:\r\n\r\n<h1>New article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= render 'form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThen do the same for the app/views/articles/edit.html.erb view:\r\n\r\n<h1>Edit article</h1>\r\n \r\n<%= render 'form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\n5.13 Deleting Articles\r\nWe're now ready to cover the \"D\" part of CRUD, deleting articles from the database. Following the REST convention, the route for deleting articles as per output of bin/rake routes is:\r\n\r\nDELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy\r\nThe delete routing method should be used for routes that destroy resources. If this was left as a typical get route, it could be possible for people to craft malicious URLs like this:\r\n\r\n<a href='http://example.com/articles/1/destroy'>look at this cat!</a>\r\nWe use the delete method for destroying resources, and this route is mapped to the destroy action inside app/controllers/articles_controller.rb, which doesn't exist yet. The destroy method is generally the last CRUD action in the controller, and like the other public CRUD actions, it must be placed before any private or protected methods. Let's add it:\r\n\r\ndef destroy\r\n  @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  @article.destroy\r\n \r\n  redirect_to articles_path\r\nend\r\nThe complete ArticlesController in the app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file should now look like this:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def show\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def new\r\n    @article = Article.new\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def edit\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.new(article_params)\r\n \r\n    if @article.save\r\n      redirect_to @article\r\n    else\r\n      render 'new'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def update\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n \r\n    if @article.update(article_params)\r\n      redirect_to @article\r\n    else\r\n      render 'edit'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def destroy\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\n    @article.destroy\r\n \r\n    redirect_to articles_path\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def article_params\r\n      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nYou can call destroy on Active Record objects when you want to delete them from the database. Note that we don't need to add a view for this action since we're redirecting to the index action.\r\n\r\nFinally, add a 'Destroy' link to your index action template (app/views/articles/index.html.erb) to wrap everything together.\r\n\r\n<h1>Listing Articles</h1>\r\n<%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Title</th>\r\n    <th>Text</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"3\"></th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n \r\n  <% @articles.each do |article| %>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><%= article.title %></td>\r\n      <td><%= article.text %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %></td>\r\n      <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', article_path(article),\r\n              method: :delete,\r\n              data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n</table>\r\nHere we're using link_to in a different way. We pass the named route as the second argument, and then the options as another argument. The :method and :'data-confirm' options are used as HTML5 attributes so that when the link is clicked, Rails will first show a confirm dialog to the user, and then submit the link with method delete. This is done via the JavaScript file jquery_ujs which is automatically included into your application's layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) when you generated the application. Without this file, the confirmation dialog box wouldn't appear.\r\n\r\nConfirm Dialog\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you can now create, show, list, update and destroy articles.\r\n\r\nIn general, Rails encourages using resources objects instead of declaring routes manually. For more information about routing, see Rails Routing from the Outside In.\r\n\r\n6 Adding a Second Model\r\nIt's time to add a second model to the application. The second model will handle comments on articles.\r\n\r\n6.1 Generating a Model\r\nWe're going to see the same generator that we used before when creating the Article model. This time we'll create a Comment model to hold reference of article comments. Run this command in your terminal:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references\r\nThis command will generate four files:\r\n\r\nFile\tPurpose\r\ndb/migrate/20140120201010_create_comments.rb\tMigration to create the comments table in your database (your name will include a different timestamp)\r\napp/models/comment.rb\tThe Comment model\r\ntest/models/comment_test.rb\tTesting harness for the comments model\r\ntest/fixtures/comments.yml\tSample comments for use in testing\r\nFirst, take a look at app/models/comment.rb:\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article\r\nend\r\nThis is very similar to the Article model that you saw earlier. The difference is the line belongs_to :article, which sets up an Active Record association. You'll learn a little about associations in the next section of this guide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the model, Rails has also made a migration to create the corresponding database table:\r\n\r\nclass CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :comments do |t|\r\n      t.string :commenter\r\n      t.text :body\r\n      t.references :article, index: true, foreign_key: true\r\n \r\n      t.timestamps null: false\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nThe t.references line creates an integer column called article_id, an index for it, and a foreign key constraint that points to the articles table. Go ahead and run the migration:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\nRails is smart enough to only execute the migrations that have not already been run against the current database, so in this case you will just see:\r\n\r\n==  CreateComments: migrating =================================================\r\n-- create_table(:comments)\r\n   -> 0.0115s\r\n==  CreateComments: migrated (0.0119s) ========================================\r\n6.2 Associating Models\r\nActive Record associations let you easily declare the relationship between two models. In the case of comments and articles, you could write out the relationships this way:\r\n\r\nEach comment belongs to one article.\r\nOne article can have many comments.\r\nIn fact, this is very close to the syntax that Rails uses to declare this association. You've already seen the line of code inside the Comment model (app/models/comment.rb) that makes each comment belong to an Article:\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article\r\nend\r\nYou'll need to edit app/models/article.rb to add the other side of the association:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\nThese two declarations enable a good bit of automatic behavior. For example, if you have an instance variable @article containing an article, you can retrieve all the comments belonging to that article as an array using @article.comments.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Active Record associations, see the Active Record Associations guide.\r\n\r\n6.3 Adding a Route for Comments\r\nAs with the welcome controller, we will need to add a route so that Rails knows where we would like to navigate to see comments. Open up the config/routes.rb file again, and edit it as follows:\r\n\r\nresources :articles do\r\n  resources :comments\r\nend\r\nThis creates comments as a nested resource within articles. This is another part of capturing the hierarchical relationship that exists between articles and comments.\r\n\r\nFor more information on routing, see the Rails Routing guide.\r\n\r\n6.4 Generating a Controller\r\nWith the model in hand, you can turn your attention to creating a matching controller. Again, we'll use the same generator we used before:\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails generate controller Comments\r\nThis creates five files and one empty directory:\r\n\r\nFile/Directory\tPurpose\r\napp/controllers/comments_controller.rb\tThe Comments controller\r\napp/views/comments/\tViews of the controller are stored here\r\ntest/controllers/comments_controller_test.rb\tThe test for the controller\r\napp/helpers/comments_helper.rb\tA view helper file\r\napp/assets/javascripts/comment.js.coffee\tCoffeeScript for the controller\r\napp/assets/stylesheets/comment.css.scss\tCascading style sheet for the controller\r\nLike with any blog, our readers will create their comments directly after reading the article, and once they have added their comment, will be sent back to the article show page to see their comment now listed. Due to this, our CommentsController is there to provide a method to create comments and delete spam comments when they arrive.\r\n\r\nSo first, we'll wire up the Article show template (app/views/articles/show.html.erb) to let us make a new comment:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis adds a form on the Article show page that creates a new comment by calling the CommentsController create action. The form_for call here uses an array, which will build a nested route, such as /articles/1/comments.\r\n\r\nLet's wire up the create in app/controllers/comments_controller.rb:\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def comment_params\r\n      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nYou'll see a bit more complexity here than you did in the controller for articles. That's a side-effect of the nesting that you've set up. Each request for a comment has to keep track of the article to which the comment is attached, thus the initial call to the find method of the Article model to get the article in question.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the code takes advantage of some of the methods available for an association. We use the create method on @article.comments to create and save the comment. This will automatically link the comment so that it belongs to that particular article.\r\n\r\nOnce we have made the new comment, we send the user back to the original article using the article_path(@article) helper. As we have already seen, this calls the show action of the ArticlesController which in turn renders the show.html.erb template. This is where we want the comment to show, so let's add that to the app/views/articles/show.html.erb.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<% @article.comments.each do |comment| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n    <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n    <%= comment.body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nNow you can add articles and comments to your blog and have them show up in the right places.\r\n\r\nArticle with Comments\r\n\r\n7 Refactoring\r\nNow that we have articles and comments working, take a look at the app/views/articles/show.html.erb template. It is getting long and awkward. We can use partials to clean it up.\r\n\r\n7.1 Rendering Partial Collections\r\nFirst, we will make a comment partial to extract showing all the comments for the article. Create the file app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb and put the following into it:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.body %>\r\n</p>\r\nThen you can change app/views/articles/show.html.erb to look like the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<%= render @article.comments %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThis will now render the partial in app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb once for each comment that is in the @article.comments collection. As the render method iterates over the @article.comments collection, it assigns each comment to a local variable named the same as the partial, in this case comment which is then available in the partial for us to show.\r\n\r\n7.2 Rendering a Partial Form\r\nLet us also move that new comment section out to its own partial. Again, you create a file app/views/comments/_form.html.erb containing:\r\n\r\n<%= form_for([@article, @article.comments.build]) do |f| %>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :commenter %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_field :commenter %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.label :body %><br>\r\n    <%= f.text_area :body %>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <%= f.submit %>\r\n  </p>\r\n<% end %>\r\nThen you make the app/views/articles/show.html.erb look like the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Title:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.title %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Text:</strong>\r\n  <%= @article.text %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h2>Comments</h2>\r\n<%= render @article.comments %>\r\n \r\n<h2>Add a comment:</h2>\r\n<%= render 'comments/form' %>\r\n \r\n<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |\r\n<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>\r\nThe second render just defines the partial template we want to render, comments/form. Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to render the _form.html.erb file in the app/views/comments directory.\r\n\r\nThe @article object is available to any partials rendered in the view because we defined it as an instance variable.\r\n\r\n8 Deleting Comments\r\nAnother important feature of a blog is being able to delete spam comments. To do this, we need to implement a link of some sort in the view and a destroy action in the CommentsController.\r\n\r\nSo first, let's add the delete link in the app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb partial:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Commenter:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.commenter %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Comment:</strong>\r\n  <%= comment.body %>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n  <%= link_to 'Destroy Comment', [comment.article, comment],\r\n               method: :delete,\r\n               data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>\r\n</p>\r\nClicking this new \"Destroy Comment\" link will fire off a DELETE\r\n/articles/:article_id/comments/:id to our CommentsController, which can then use this to find the comment we want to delete, so let's add a destroy action to our controller (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb):\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  def destroy\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    @comment = @article.comments.find(params[:id])\r\n    @comment.destroy\r\n    redirect_to article_path(@article)\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  private\r\n    def comment_params\r\n      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\nThe destroy action will find the article we are looking at, locate the comment within the @article.comments collection, and then remove it from the database and send us back to the show action for the article.\r\n\r\n8.1 Deleting Associated Objects\r\nIf you delete an article, its associated comments will also need to be deleted, otherwise they would simply occupy space in the database. Rails allows you to use the dependent option of an association to achieve this. Modify the Article model, app/models/article.rb, as follows:\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy\r\n  validates :title, presence: true,\r\n                    length: { minimum: 5 }\r\nend\r\n9 Security\r\n9.1 Basic Authentication\r\nIf you were to publish your blog online, anyone would be able to add, edit and delete articles or delete comments.\r\n\r\nRails provides a very simple HTTP authentication system that will work nicely in this situation.\r\n\r\nIn the ArticlesController we need to have a way to block access to the various actions if the person is not authenticated. Here we can use the Rails http_basic_authenticate_with method, which allows access to the requested action if that method allows it.\r\n\r\nTo use the authentication system, we specify it at the top of our ArticlesController in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb. In our case, we want the user to be authenticated on every action except index and show, so we write that:\r\n\r\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\r\n \r\n  http_basic_authenticate_with name: \"dhh\", password: \"secret\", except: [:index, :show]\r\n \r\n  def index\r\n    @articles = Article.all\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nWe also want to allow only authenticated users to delete comments, so in the CommentsController (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb) we write:\r\n\r\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\r\n \r\n  http_basic_authenticate_with name: \"dhh\", password: \"secret\", only: :destroy\r\n \r\n  def create\r\n    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\n \r\n  # snippet for brevity\r\nNow if you try to create a new article, you will be greeted with a basic HTTP Authentication challenge:\r\n\r\nBasic HTTP Authentication Challenge\r\n\r\nOther authentication methods are available for Rails applications. Two popular authentication add-ons for Rails are the Devise rails engine and the Authlogic gem, along with a number of others.\r\n\r\n9.2 Other Security Considerations\r\nSecurity, especially in web applications, is a broad and detailed area. Security in your Rails application is covered in more depth in the Ruby on Rails Security Guide.\r\n\r\n10 What's Next?\r\nNow that you've seen your first Rails application, you should feel free to update it and experiment on your own. But you don't have to do everything without help. As you need assistance getting up and running with Rails, feel free to consult these support resources:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby on Rails Guides\r\nThe Ruby on Rails Tutorial\r\nThe Ruby on Rails mailing list\r\nThe #rubyonrails channel on irc.freenode.net\r\nRails also comes with built-in help that you can generate using the rake command-line utility:\r\n\r\nRunning rake doc:guides will put a full copy of the Rails Guides in the doc/guides folder of your application. Open doc/guides/index.html in your web browser to explore the Guides.\r\nRunning rake doc:rails will put a full copy of the API documentation for Rails in the doc/api folder of your application. Open doc/api/index.html in your web browser to explore the API documentation.\r\nTo be able to generate the Rails Guides locally with the doc:guides rake task you need to install the RedCloth and Nokogiri gems. Add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install and you're ready to go.\r\n\r\n11 Configuration Gotchas\r\nThe easiest way to work with Rails is to store all external data as UTF-8. If you don't, Ruby libraries and Rails will often be able to convert your native data into UTF-8, but this doesn't always work reliably, so you're better off ensuring that all external data is UTF-8.\r\n\r\nIf you have made a mistake in this area, the most common symptom is a black diamond with a question mark inside appearing in the browser. Another common symptom is characters like \"Ã¼\" appearing instead of \"ü\". Rails takes a number of internal steps to mitigate common causes of these problems that can be automatically detected and corrected. However, if you have external data that is not stored as UTF-8, it can occasionally result in these kinds of issues that cannot be automatically detected by Rails and corrected.\r\n\r\nTwo very common sources of data that are not UTF-8:\r\n\r\nYour text editor: Most text editors (such as TextMate), default to saving files as UTF-8. If your text editor does not, this can result in special characters that you enter in your templates (such as é) to appear as a diamond with a question mark inside in the browser. This also applies to your i18n translation files. Most editors that do not already default to UTF-8 (such as some versions of Dreamweaver) offer a way to change the default to UTF-8. Do so.\r\nYour database: Rails defaults to converting data from your database into UTF-8 at the boundary. However, if your database is not using UTF-8 internally, it may not be able to store all characters that your users enter. For instance, if your database is using Latin-1 internally, and your user enters a Russian, Hebrew, or Japanese character, the data will be lost forever once it enters the database. If possible, use UTF-8 as the internal storage of your database.\r\nFeedback\r\nYou're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide.\r\n\r\nPlease contribute if you see any typos or factual errors.

For the film, see Illuminata (film). For the Muslim esoteric school, see Illuminationism. For other uses, see Illuminati (disambiguation).\r\n\r\nAdam Weishaupt (1748–1830), founder of the Bavarian Illuminati\r\nThe Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, \"enlightened\") is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. \"The order of the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.\"[1] The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent use, \"Illuminati\" refers to various organisations which claim or are purported to have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, though these links are unsubstantiated. They are often alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, movies, television shows, comics, video games, and music videos.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n1 History\r\n1.1 Origins\r\n1.2 Transition\r\n1.3 Reform\r\n1.3.1 Adolph Knigge\r\n1.3.2 Internal problems\r\n1.3.3 New system\r\n1.4 Attempts at expansion\r\n1.4.1 Convent of Wilhelmsbad\r\n1.4.2 Aftermath of Wilhelmsbad\r\n1.5 Zenith\r\n1.6 Conflict with Rosicrucians\r\n1.7 Internal dissent\r\n1.8 Decline\r\n2 Barruel and Robison\r\n3 Modern Illuminati\r\n4 Popular culture\r\n4.1 Modern conspiracy theory\r\n4.2 Novels\r\n5 References\r\n6 Other reading\r\n7 External links\r\nHistory\r\nOrigins\r\n\r\nThe Owl of Minerva perched on a book was an emblem used by the Bavarian Illuminati in their \"Minerval\" degree.\r\nAdam Weishaupt (1748-1830) was a professor of Canon Law and Practical philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order had been dissolved in 1773. The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the University, which they continued to regard as their own. Constant attempts were made to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant. Weishaupt became deeply anti-clerical, resolving to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment (Aufklärung) through some sort of secret society of like-minded individuals.[3]\r\n\r\nFinding Freemasonry to be expensive, and not open to his ideas, he founded his own society which was to have a gradal system based on Freemasonry, but his own agenda.[3] His original name for the new order was Bund der Perfektibilisten, or Covenant of Perfectibility (Perfectibilists), later changing it because it sounded too strange.[4] On 1 May 1776 Weishaupt and four students formed the Perfectibilists, taking the Owl of Minerva as their symbol.[5][6] The members were to use aliases within the society. Weishaupt became Spartacus. Law students Massenhausen, Bauhof, Merz and Sutor became respectively Ajax, Agathon, Tiberius and Erasmus Roterodamus. Weishaupt later expelled Sutor for indolence.[7][8] It was not until April 1778 that the order became the Illuminatenorden, or Order of Illuminati, after Weishaupt had seriously contemplated the Bee order.[9]\r\n\r\nMassenhausen was initially the most active in expanding the society. Significantly, while studying in Munich shortly after the formation of the order, he recruited Xavier von Zwack, a former pupil of Weishaupt at the beginning of a significant administrative career. (At the time, he was in charge of the Bavarian National Lottery). Massenhausen's enthusiasm soon became a liability in the eyes of Weishaupt, often attempting to recruit unsuitable candidates. Later, his erratic love-life made him neglectful, and as Weishaupt passed control of the Munich group to Zwack, it became clear that Massenhausen had misappropriated subscriptions and intercepted correspondence between Weishaupt and Zwack. In 1778, Massenhausen graduated and took a post outside Bavaria, taking no further interest in the order. At this time, the order had a nominal membership of twelve.[7]\r\n\r\nWith the departure of Massenhausen, Zwack immediately applied himself to recruiting more mature and important recruits. Most prized by Weishaupt was Hertel, a childhood friend and a canon of the Munich Frauenkirche. By the end of summer 1778 the order had 27 members (still counting Massenhausen) in 5 commands; Munich (Athens), Ingolstadt (Eleusis), Ravensberg (Sparta), Freysingen (Thebes), and Eichstaedt (Erzurum).[7]\r\n\r\nDuring this early period, the order had three grades of Novice, Minerval, and Illuminated Minerval, of which only the Minerval grade involved a complicated ceremony. In this the candidate was given secret signs and a password. A system of mutual espionage kept Weishaupt informed of the activities and character of all his members, his favourites becoming members of the ruling council, or Areopagus. Some novices were permitted to recruit, becoming Insinuants. Christians of good character were expected, with Jews and Pagans specifically excluded, along with women, monks, and members of other secret societies. Favoured candidates were rich, docile, willing to learn, and aged 18–30.[10][11]\r\n\r\nTransition\r\nHaving, with difficulty, dissuaded some of his members from joining the Freemasons, Weishaupt decided to join the older order to acquire material to expand his own ritual. He was admitted to lodge \"Prudence\" of the Rite of Strict Observance early in February 1777. His progress through the three degrees of \"blue lodge\" masonry taught him nothing of the higher degrees he sought to exploit, but in the following year a priest called Abbé Marotti informed Zwack that these inner secrets rested on knowledge of the older religion and the primitive church. Zwack persuaded Weishaupt that their own order should enter into friendly relations with Freemasonry, and obtain the dispensation to set up their own lodge. At this stage (December 1778), the addition of the first three degrees of Freemasonry was seen as a secondary project.[12]\r\n\r\nWith little difficulty, a warrant was obtained from the Grand Lodge of Prussia called the Royal York for Friendship, and the new lodge was called Theodore of the Good Council, with the intention of flattering Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. It was founded in Munich on 21 March 1779, and quickly packed with Illuminati. The first master, a man called Radl, was persuaded to return home to Baden, and by July Weishaupt's order ran the lodge.[12]\r\n\r\nThe next step involved independence from their Grand Lodge. By establishing masonic relations with the Union lodge in Frankfurt, affiliated to the Premier Grand Lodge of England, lodge Theodore became independently recognised, and able to declare its independence. As a new mother lodge, it could now spawn lodges of its own. The recruiting drive amongst the Frankfurt masons also obtained the allegiance of Adolph Freiherr Knigge.[12]\r\n\r\nReform\r\nAdolph Knigge\r\n\r\nAdolph Freiherr Knigge, the most effective recruiter for the Illuminati\r\nKnigge was recruited late in 1780 at a convention of the Rite of Strict Observance by Costanzo Marchese di Costanzo, an infantry captain in the Bavarian army and a fellow Freemason. Knigge, still in his twenties, had already reached the highest initiatory grades of his order, and had arrived with his own grand plans for its reform. Disappointed that his scheme found no support, Knigge was immediately intrigued when Costanzo informed him that the order that he sought to create already existed. Knigge and three of his friends expressed a strong interest in learning more of this order, and Costanzo showed them material relating to the Minerval grade. The teaching material for the grade was \"liberal\" literature which was banned in Bavaria, but common knowledge in the Protestant German states. Knigge's three companions became disillusioned and had no more to do with Costanza, but Knigge's persistence was rewarded in November 1780 by a letter from Weishaupt. Knigge's connections, both within and outside of Freemasonry, made him an ideal recruit. Knigge, for his own part, was flattered by the attention, and drawn towards the order's stated aims of education and the protection of mankind from despotism. Weishaupt managed to acknowledge, and pledge to support, Knigge's interest in alchemy and the \"higher sciences\". Knigge replied to Weishaupt outlining his plans for the reform of Freemasonry as the Strict Observance began to question its own origins.[13]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt set Knigge the task of recruiting before he could be admitted to the higher grades of the order. Knigge accepted, on the condition that he was allowed to choose his own recruiting grounds. Many other masons found Knigge's description of the new masonic order attractive, and were enrolled in the Minerval grade of the Illuminati. Knigge appeared at this time to believe in the \"Most Serene Superiors\" which Weishaupt claimed to serve. His inability to articulate anything about the higher degrees of the order became increasingly embarrassing, but in delaying any help, Weishaupt gave him an extra task. Provided with material by Weishaupt, Knigge now produced pamphlets outlining the activities of the outlawed Jesuits, purporting to show how they continued to thrive and recruit, especially in Bavaria. Meanwhile, Knigge's inability to give his recruits any satisfactory response to questions regarding the higher grades was making his position untenable, and he wrote to Weishaupt to this effect. In January 1781, faced with the prospect of losing Knigge and his masonic recruits, Weishaupt finally confessed that his superiors and the supposed antiquity of the order were fictions, and the higher degrees had yet to be written.[13]\r\n\r\nIf Knigge had expected to learn the promised deep secrets of Freemasonry in the higher degrees of the Illuminati, he was surprisingly calm about Weishaupt's revelation. Weishaupt promised Knigge a free hand in the creation of the higher degrees, and also promised to send him his own notes. For his own part, Knigge welcomed the opportunity to use the order as a vehicle for his own ideas. His new approach would, he claimed, make the Illuminati more attractive to prospective members in the Protestant kingdoms of Germany. In November of 1781 the Areopagus advanced Knigge 50 florins to travel to Bavaria, which he did via Swabia and Franconia, meeting and enjoying the hospitality of other Illuminati on his journey.[14]\r\n\r\nInternal problems\r\nThe order had now developed profound internal divisions. The Eichstaedt command had formed an autonomous province in July 1780, and a rift was growing between Weishaupt and the Areopagus, who found him stubborn, dictatorial, and inconsistent. Knigge fitted readily into the role of peacemaker.[14]\r\n\r\nIn discussions with the Areopagus and Weishaupt, Knigge identified two areas which were problematic. Weishaupt's emphasis on the recruitment of university students meant that senior positions in the order often had to be filled by young men with little practical experience. Secondly, the anti-Jesuit ethos of the order at its inception had become a general anti-religious sentiment, which Knigge knew would be a problem in recruiting the senior Freemasons that the order now sought to attract. Knigge felt keenly the stifling grip of conservative Catholicism in Bavaria, and understood the anti-religious feelings that this produced in the liberal Illuminati, but he also saw the negative impression these same feelings would engender in Protestant states, inhibiting the spread of the order in greater Germany. Both the Areopagus and Weishaupt felt powerless to do anything less than give Knigge a free hand. He had the contacts within and outside of Freemasonry that they needed, and he had the skill as a ritualist to build their projected gradal structure, where they had ground to a halt at Illuminatus Minor, with only the Minerval grade below and the merest sketches of higher grades. The only restrictions imposed were the need to discuss the inner secrets of the highest grades, and the necessity of submitting his new grades for approval.[14]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the scheme to propagate Illuminatism as a legitimate branch of Freemasonry had stalled. While Lodge Theodore was now in their control, a chapter of \"Elect Masters\" attached to it only had one member from the order, and still had a constitutional superiority to the craft lodge controlled by the Illuminati. The chapter would be difficult to persuade to submit to the Areopagus, and formed a very real barrier to Lodge Theodore becoming the first mother-lodge of a new Illuminated Freemasonry. A treaty of alliance was signed between the order and the chapter, and by the end of January 1781 four daughter lodges had been created, but independence was not in the chapter's agenda.[14]\r\n\r\nCostanza wrote to the Royal York pointing out the discrepancy between the fees dispatched to their new Grand Lodge and the service they had received in return. The Royal York, unwilling to lose the revenue, offered to confer the \"higher\" secrets of Freemasonry on a representative that their Munich brethren would dispatch to Berlin. Costanza accordingly set off for Prussia on 4 April 1780, with instructions to negotiate a reduction in Theodore's fees while he was there. On the way, he managed to have an argument with a Frenchman on the subject of a lady with whom they were sharing a carriage. The Frenchman sent a message ahead to the king, some time before they reached Berlin, denouncing Costanza as a spy. He was only freed from prison with the help of the Grand Master of Royal York, and was expelled from Prussia having accomplished nothing.[14]\r\n\r\nNew system\r\nKnigge's initial plan to obtain a constitution from London would, they realised, have been seen through by the chapter. Until such time as they could take over other masonic lodges that their chapter could not control, they were for the moment content to rewrite the three degrees for the lodges which they administered.[14]\r\n\r\nOn 20 January 1782 Knigge tabulated his new system of grades for the order. These were arranged in three classes:\r\n\r\nClass I – The nursery, consisting of the Noviciate, the Minerval, and Illuminatus minor.\r\nClass II – The Masonic grades. The three \"blue lodge\" grades of Apprentice, Companion, and Master were separated from the higher \"Scottish\" grades of Scottish Novice and Scottish Knight.\r\nClass III – The Mysteries. The lesser mysteries were the grades of Priest and Prince, followed by the greater mysteries in the grades of Mage and King. It is unlikely that the rituals for the greater mysteries were ever written.[14][15]\r\nAttempts at expansion\r\nKnigge's recruitment from German Freemasonry was far from random. He targeted the masters and wardens, the men who ran the lodges, and were often able to place the entire lodge at the disposal of the Illuminati. In Aachen, Baron de Witte, master of Constancy lodge, caused every member to join the order. In this way, the order expanded rapidly in central and southern Germany, and obtained a foothold in Austria. Moving into the Spring of 1782, the handful of students that had started the order had swelled to about 300 members, only 20 of the new recruits being students.[16]\r\n\r\nIn Munich, the first half of 1782 saw huge changes in the government of Lodge Theodore. In February, Weishaupt had offered to split the lodge, with the Illuminati going their own way and the chapter taking any remaining traditionalists into their own continuation of Theodore. At this point, the chapter unexpectedly capitulated, and the Illuminati had complete control of lodge and chapter. In June, both lodge and chapter sent letters severing relations with Royal York, citing their own faithfulness in paying for their recognition, and Royal York's failure to provide any instruction into the higher grades. Their neglect of Costanza, failure to defend him from malicious charges or prevent his expulsion from Prussia, were also cited. They had made no effort to provide Costanza with the promised secrets, and the Munich masons now suspected that their brethren in Berlin relied on the mystical French higher grades which they sought to avoid. Lodge Theodore was now independent.[16]\r\n\r\nThe Rite of Strict Observance was now in a critical state. Its nominal leader was Prince Carl of Södermanland (later Charles XIII of Sweden), openly suspected of trying to absorb the rite into the Swedish Rite, which he already controlled. The German lodges looked for leadership to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Suspicion turned to open contempt when it transpired that Carl regarded the Stuart heir as the true Grand Master, and the lodges of the Strict Observance all but ignored their Grand Master. This impasse led to the Convent of Wilhelmsbad.[16]\r\n\r\nConvent of Wilhelmsbad\r\n\r\n\"Ruined\" castle built by Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel in the park at Wilhelmsbad, venue for the last convent of the Strict Observance\r\nDelayed from 15 October 1781, the last convention of the Strict Observance finally opened on 16 July 1782 in the spa town of Wilhelmsbad on the outskirts of (now part of) Hanau. Ostensibly a discussion of the future of the order, the 35 delegates knew that the Strict Observance in its current form was doomed, and that the Convent of Wilhelmsbad would be a struggle over the pieces between the German mystics, under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and their host Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, and the Martinists, under Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. The only dissenting voices to mystical higher grades were Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, who was horrified by Martinism, but whose proposed alternatives were as yet unformed, and Franz Dietrich von Ditfurth, a judge from Wetzlar and master of the Joseph of the Three Helmets lodge there, who was already a member of the Illuminati. Ditfurth publicly campaigned for a return to the basic three degrees of Freemasonry, which was the least likely outcome of the convention. The mystics already had coherent plans to replace the higher degrees.[16]\r\n\r\nThe lack of a coherent alternative to the two strains of mysticism allowed the Illuminati to present themselves as a credible option. Ditfurth, prompted and assisted by Knigge, who now had full authority to act for the order, became their spokesman. Knigge's original plan to propose an alliance between the two orders was rejected by Weishaupt, who saw no point in an alliance with a dying order. His new plan was to recruit the masons opposed to the \"Templar\" higher degree of the Strict Observance.[16]\r\n\r\nAt the convent, Ditfurth blocked the attempts of Willermoz and Hesse to introduce their own higher grades by insisting that full details of such degrees be revealed to the delegates. The frustration of the German mystics led to their enrolling Count Kollowrat with the Illuminati with a view to later affiliation. Ditfurth's own agenda was to replace all of the higher degrees with a single fourth degree, with no pretensions to further masonic revelations. Finding no support for his plan, he left the convent prematurely, writing to the Areopagus that he expected nothing good of the assembly.[16]\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to satisfy everybody, the Convent of Wilhelmsbad achieved little. They renounced the Templar origins of their ritual, while retaining the Templar titles, trappings and administrative structure. Charles of Hesse and Ferdinand of Brunswick remained at the head of the order, but in practice the lodges were almost independent. The Germans also adopted the name of the French order of Willermoz, les Chevaliers bienfaisants de la Cité sainte (Good Knights of the Holy City), and some Martinist mysticism was imported into the first three degrees, which were now the only essential degrees of Freemasonry. Crucially, individual lodges of the order were now allowed to fraternise with lodges of other systems. The new \"Scottish Grade\" introduced with the Lyon ritual of Willermoz was not compulsory, each province and prefecture was free to decide what, if anything, happened after the three craft degrees. Finally, in an effort to show that something had been achieved, the convent regulated at length on etiquette, titles, and a new numbering for the provinces.[16]\r\n\r\nAftermath of Wilhelmsbad\r\nWhat the Convent of Wilhelmsbad actually achieved was the demise of the Strict Observance. It renounced its own origin myth, along with the higher degrees which bound its highest and most influential members. It abolished the strict control which had kept the order united, and alienated many Germans who mistrusted Martinism. Bode, who was repelled by Martinism, immediately entered negotiations with Knigge, and finally joined the Illuminati in January 1783. Charles of Hesse joined the following month.[16]\r\n\r\nKnigge's first efforts at an alliance with the intact German Grand Lodges failed, but Weishaupt persisted. He proposed a new federation where all of the German lodges would practice an agreed, unified system in the essential three degrees of Freemasonry, and be left to their own devices as to which, if any, system of higher degrees they wished to pursue. This would be a federation of Grand Lodges, and members would be free to visit any of the \"blue\" lodges, in any jurisdiction. All lodge masters would be elected, and no fees would be paid to any central authority whatsoever. Groups of lodges would be subject to a \"Scottish Directorate\", composed of members delegated by lodges, to audit finances, settle disputes, and authorise new lodges. These in turn would elect Provincial Directorates, who would elect inspectors, who would elect the national director. This system would correct the current imbalance in German Freemasonry, where masonic ideals of equality were preserved only in the lower three \"symbolic\" degrees. The various systems of higher degrees were dominated by the elite who could afford researches in alchemy and mysticism. To Weishaupt and Knigge, the proposed federation was also a vehicle to propagate Illuminism throughout German Freemasonry. Their intention was to use their new federation, with its emphasis on the fundamental degrees, to remove all allegiance to Strict Observance, allowing the \"eclectic\" system of the Illuminati to take its place.[16]\r\n\r\nThe circular announcing the new federation outlined the faults of German freemasonry, that unsuitable men with money were often admitted on the basis of their wealth, that the corruption of civil society had infected the lodges. Having advocated the de-regulation of the higher grades of the German lodges, the Illuminati now announced their own, from their \"unknown Superiors\". Lodge Theodore, newly independent from Royal York, set themselves up as a provincial Grand Lodge. Knigge, in a letter to all the Royal York lodges, now accused that Grand Lodge of decadence. Their Freemasonry had allegedly been corrupted by the Jesuits. Strict Observance was now attacked as a creation of the Stuarts, devoid of all moral virtue. The Zinnendorf rite of the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany was suspect because its author was in league with the Swedes. This direct attack had the opposite effect to that intended by Weishaupt, it offended many of its readers. The Grand Lodge of the Grand Orient of Warsaw, which controlled Freemasonry in Poland and Lithuania, was happy to participate in the federation only as far as the first three degrees. Their insistence on independence had kept them from the Strict Observance, and would now keep them from the Illuminati, whose plan to annex Freemasonry rested on their own higher degrees. By the end of January 1783 the Illuminati's masonic contingent had seven lodges.[16]\r\n\r\nIt was not only the clumsy appeal of the Illuminati that left the federation short of members. Lodge Theodore was recently formed and did not command respect like the older lodges. Most of all, the Freemasons most likely to be attracted to the federation saw the Illuminati as an ally against the mystics and Martinists, but valued their own freedom too highly to be caught in another restrictive organisation. Even Ditfurth, the supposed representative of the Illuminati at Wilhelmsbad, had pursued his own agenda at the convent.[16]\r\n\r\nThe non-mystical Frankfurt lodges created an \"Eclectic Alliance\", which was almost indistinguishable in constitution and aims from the Illuminati's federation. Far from seeing this as a threat, after some discussion the Illuminati lodges joined the new alliance. Three Illuminati now sat on the committee charged with writing the new masonic statutes. Aside from strengthening relations between their three lodges, the Illuminati seem to have gained no advantage from this manoeuvre. Ditfurth, having found a masonic organisation that worked towards his own ambitions for Freemasonry, took little interest in the Illuminati after his adherence to the Eclectic Alliance. In reality, the creation of the Eclectic Alliance had undermined all of the subtle plans of the Illuminati to spread their own doctrine through Freemasonry.[16]\r\n\r\nZenith\r\nAlthough their hopes of mass recruitment through Freemasonry had been frustrated, the Illuminati continued to recruit well at an individual level. In Bavaria, the succession of Charles Theodore initially led to a liberalisation of attitudes and laws, but the clergy and courtiers, guarding their own power and privilege, persuaded the weak willed monarch to reverse his reforms, and Bavaria's repression of liberal thought returned. This reversal led to a general resentment of the monarch and the church among the educated classes, which provided a perfect recruiting ground for the Illuminati. A number of Freemasons from Prudence lodge, disaffected by the Martinist rites of the Chevaliers Bienfaisants, joined lodge Theodore, who set themselves up in a gardened mansion which contained their library of liberal literature.[17]\r\n\r\nIlluminati circles in the rest of Germany expanded. While some had only modest gains, the circle in Mainz almost doubled from 31 to 61 members. Reaction to state Catholicism led to gains in Austria, and footholds were obtained in Warsaw, Pressburg (Bratislava), Tyrol, Milan and Switzerland.[17]\r\n\r\nThe total number of verifiable members at the end of 1784 is around 650. Weishaupt and Hertel later claimed a figure of 2,500. The higher figure is largely explained by the inclusion of members of masonic lodges that the Illuminati claimed to control, but it is likely that the names of all the Illuminati are not known, and the true figure lies somewhere between 650 and 2,500. The importance of the order lay in its successful recruitment of the professional classes, churchmen, academics, doctors and lawyers, and its more recent acquisition of powerful benefactors. Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg with his brother and later successor August, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg governor of Erfurt, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (already mentioned), his chief assistant in masonic matters, Johann Friedrich von Schwarz, and Count Metternich of Koblenz were all enrolled. In Vienna, Count Brigido, governor of Galicia, Count Leopold Kolowrat, chancellor of Bohemia with his vice-chancellor Baron Kressel, Count Pálffy von Erdöd, chancellor of Hungary, Count Banffy, governor and provincial Grand Master of Transylvania, Count Stadion, ambassador to London, and Baron von Swieten, minister of public education, also joined.[17]\r\n\r\nThere were notable failures. Johann Kaspar Lavater, the Swiss poet and theologian, rebuffed Knigge. He did not believe the order's humanitarian and rationalist aims were achievable by secret means. He further believed that a society's drive for members would ultimately submerge its founding ideals. Christoph Friedrich Nicolai, the Berlin writer and bookseller, became disillusioned after joining. He found its aims chimeric, and thought that the use of Jesuit methods to achieve their aims was dangerous. He remained in the order, but took no part in recruitment.[17]\r\n\r\nConflict with Rosicrucians\r\nAt all costs, Weishaupt wished to keep the existence of the order secret from the Rosicrucians, who already had a considerable foothold in German Freemasonry. While clearly Protestant, the Rosicrucians were anything but anticlerical, pro-monarchic, and held views clearly conflicting with the Illuminati vision of a rationalist state run by philosophers and scientists. The Rosicrucians were not above promoting their own brand of mysticism with fraudulent seances. A conflict became inevitable as the existence of the Illuminati became more evident, and as prominent Rosicrucians, and mystics with Rosicrucian sympathies, were actively recruited by Knigge and other over-enthusiastic helpers. Kolowrat was already a high ranking Rosicrucian, and the mystic Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel had a very low opinion of the rationalist higher grades of the Illuminati.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Rosicrucians, under Johann Christoph von Wöllner, began a sustained attack on the Illuminati. Wöllner had a specially engineered room in which he convinced potential patrons of the effectiveness of Rosicrucian \"magic\", and his order had acquired effective control of the Three Globes and its attached lodges. Through this mouthpiece, the Illuminati were accused of Atheism and revolutionary tendencies. In April 1783 Frederick the Great informed Charles of Hesse that the Berlin lodges had documents belonging to the Minervals or Illuminati which contained appalling material, and asked if he had heard of them. All Berlin masons were now warned against the order, which was now accused of Socinianism, and of using the liberal writings of Voltaire and others, alongside the tolerance of Freemasonry, to undermine all religion. In November 1783 the Three Globes described the Illuminati as a masonic sect which sought to undermine Christianity and turn Freemasonry into a political system. Their final anathema, in November 1784, refused to recognise any Illuminati as Freemasons.[17]\r\n\r\nIn Austria, the Illuminati were blamed for anti-religious pamphlets that had recently appeared. The Rosicrucians spied on Joseph von Sonnenfels and other suspected Illuminati, and their campaign of denunciation within Freemasonry completely shut down Illuminati recruitment in Tyrol.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian Illuminati, whose existence was already known to the Rosicrucians from an informant, were further betrayed by the reckless actions of Ferdinand Maria Baader, an Areopagite who now joined the Rosicrucians. Shortly after his admission it was made known to his superiors that he was one of the Illuminati, and he was informed that he could not be a member of both organisations. His letter of resignation stated that the Rosicrucians did not possess secret knowledge, and ignored the truly Illuminated, specifically identifying Lodge Theodore as an Illuminati Lodge.[17]\r\n\r\nInternal dissent\r\nAs the Illuminati embraced Freemasonry and expanded outside Bavaria, the council of the Areopagites was replaced by an ineffective \"Council of Provincials\". The Areopagites, however, remained as powerful voices within the Order, and began again to bicker with Weishaupt as soon as Knigge left Munich. Weishaupt responded by privately slandering his perceived enemies in letters to his perceived friends.[17]\r\n\r\nMore seriously, Weishaupt succeeded in alienating Knigge. Weishaupt had ceded considerable power to Knigge in deputising him to write the ritual, power he now sought to regain. Knigge had elevated the Order from a tiny anti-clerical club to a large organisation, and felt that his work was under-acknowledged. Weishaupt's continuing anti-clericalism clashed with Knigge's mysticism, and recruitment of mystically inclined Freemasons was a cause of friction with Weishaupt and other senior Illuminati, such as Ditfurth. Matters came to a head over the grade of Priest. The consensus among many of the Illuminati was that the ritual was florid and ill-conceived, and the regalia puerile and expensive. Some refused to use it, others edited it. Weishaupt demanded that Knigge rewrite the ritual. Knigge pointed out that it was already circulated, with Weishaupt's blessing, as ancient. This fell on deaf ears. Weishaupt now claimed to other Illuminati that the Priest ritual was flawed because Knigge had invented it. Offended, Knigge now threatened to tell the world how much of the Illuminati ritual he had made up. Knigge's attempt to create a convention of the Areopagites proved fruitless, as most of them trusted him even less than they trusted Weishaupt. In July 1784 Knigge left the order by agreement, under which he returned all relevant papers, and Weishaupt published a retraction of all slanders against him.[17] In forcing Knigge out, Weishaupt deprived the order of its best theoretician, recruiter, and apologist.[15]\r\n\r\nDecline\r\nThe final decline of the Illuminati was brought about by the indiscretions of their own Minervals in Bavaria, and especially in Munich. In spite of efforts by their superiors to curb loose talk, politically dangerous boasts of power and criticism of monarchy caused the \"secret\" order's existence to become common knowledge, along with the names of many important members. The presence of Illuminati in positions of power now led to some public disquiet. There were Illuminati in many civic and state governing bodies. In spite of their small number, there were claims that success in a legal dispute depended on the litigant's standing with the order. The Illuminati were blamed for several anti-religious publications then appearing in Bavaria. Much of this criticism sprang from vindictiveness and jealousy, but it is clear that many Illuminati court officials gave preferential treatment to their brethren. In Bavaria, the energy of their two members of the Ecclesiastical Council had one of them elected treasurer. Their opposition to Jesuits resulted in the banned order losing key academic and church positions. In Ingolstat, the Jesuit heads of department were replaced by Illuminati.[18]\r\n\r\nAlarmed, Karl Theodor and his government banned all secret societies including the Illuminati.[19] A government edict dated March 2, 1785 \"seems to have been deathblow to the Illuminati in Bavaria\". Weishaupt had fled and documents and internal correspondence, seized in 1786 and 1787, were subsequently published by the government in 1787.[20] Von Zwack's home was searched and much of the group's literature was disclosed.[21]\r\n\r\nMany influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was the Order's second-in-command.[21] It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar.[22]\r\n\r\nBarruel and Robison\r\nBetween 1797 and 1798, Augustin Barruel's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism and John Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy publicised the theory that the Illuminati had survived and represented an ongoing international conspiracy. This included the claim that it was behind the French Revolution. Both books proved to be very popular, spurring reprints and paraphrases by others.[23] A prime example of this is Proofs of the Real Existence, and Dangerous Tendency, Of Illuminism by Reverend Seth Payson, published in 1802.[24] Some of the response to this was critical, for example Jean-Joseph Mounier's On the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, Free-Masons, and to the Illuminati on the Revolution of France.[25][26]\r\n\r\nThe works of Robison and Barruel made their way to the United States, and across New England, Reverend Jedidiah Morse and others gave sermons against the Illuminati. Their sermons were printed and the matter was followed in newspapers. Concern died down in the first decade of the 1800s, although it revived from time to time in the Anti-Masonic movement of the 1820s and 30s.[3]\r\n\r\nModern Illuminati\r\nSeveral recent and present-day fraternal organisations claim to be descended from the original Bavarian Illuminati and openly use the name \"Illuminati\". Some of these groups use a variation on the name \"The Illuminati Order\" in the name of their own organisations,[27][28] while others, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, have \"Illuminati\" as a level within their organisation's hierarchy. However, there is no evidence that these present-day groups have amassed significant political power or influence, and rather than trying to remain secret, they promote unsubstantiated links to the Bavarian Illuminati as a means of attracting membership.[19]\r\n\r\nPopular culture\r\nMain article: Illuminati in popular culture\r\nModern conspiracy theory\r\nMain article: New World Order (conspiracy theory) § Illuminati\r\nThe Illuminati did not long survive their suppression in Bavaria, and their further mischief and plottings in the work of Barruel and Robison must be considered as the invention of the writers.[3] However, writers such as Mark Dice,[29] David Icke, Texe Marrs, Jüri Lina and Morgan Gricar have argued that the Bavarian Illuminati have survived, possibly to this day.\r\n\r\nMany modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati.[30][31] Conspiracy theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati. Presidents of the United States are a common target for such claims.[32][33]\r\n\r\nOther theorists contend that a variety of historical events were orchestrated by the Illuminati, from the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and President John F. Kennedy's assassination to an alleged communist plot to hasten the New World Order by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry.[34][35]\r\n\r\nSome conspiracy theorists claim that the Illuminati observe Satanic rituals.[36][37]\r\n\r\nCriticism and satire of this theory has became so common that it is now a minor internet meme, with users identifying triangles in pieces of media, superimposing the Annuit cœptis over the triangle and then (usually in the form of an image macro) proclaiming that said work is a work of the Iluminati.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nNovels\r\nThe Illuminati, or fictitious modern groups called the Illuminati, play a central role in the plots of many novels, for example The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. They also make an appearance in Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. A mixture of historical fact and established conspiracy theory, or pure fiction, is used to portray them.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n^ Richard van Dülmen, The Society of Enlightenment (Polity Press 1992) p. 110\r\n^ René le Forestier, Les Illuminés de Bavière et la franc-maçonnerie allemande, Paris, 1914, pp. 453, 468-9, 507-8, 614-5\r\n^ a b c d Vernon Stauffer, New England and the Bavarian Illuminati, Columbia University Press, 1918, Chapter 3 The European Illuminati, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon, accessed 14 November 2015\r\n^ Weishaupt, Adam (1790).

For the Muslim esoteric school, see Illuminationism. For other uses, see Illuminati (disambiguation).\r\n\r\nAdam Weishaupt (1748–1830), founder of the Bavarian Illuminati\r\nThe Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, \"enlightened\") is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. \"The order of the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.\"[1] The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent use, \"Illuminati\" refers to various organisations which claim or are purported to have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, though these links are unsubstantiated. They are often alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, movies, television shows, comics, video games, and music videos.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n1 History\r\n1.1 Origins\r\n1.2 Transition\r\n1.3 Reform\r\n1.3.1 Adolph Knigge\r\n1.3.2 Internal problems\r\n1.3.3 New system\r\n1.4 Attempts at expansion\r\n1.4.1 Convent of Wilhelmsbad\r\n1.4.2 Aftermath of Wilhelmsbad\r\n1.5 Zenith\r\n1.6 Conflict with Rosicrucians\r\n1.7 Internal dissent\r\n1.8 Decline\r\n2 Barruel and Robison\r\n3 Modern Illuminati\r\n4 Popular culture\r\n4.1 Modern conspiracy theory\r\n4.2 Novels\r\n5 References\r\n6 Other reading\r\n7 External links\r\nHistory\r\nOrigins\r\n\r\nThe Owl of Minerva perched on a book was an emblem used by the Bavarian Illuminati in their \"Minerval\" degree.\r\nAdam Weishaupt (1748-1830) was a professor of Canon Law and Practical philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order had been dissolved in 1773. The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the University, which they continued to regard as their own. Constant attempts were made to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant. Weishaupt became deeply anti-clerical, resolving to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment (Aufklärung) through some sort of secret society of like-minded individuals.[3]\r\n\r\nFinding Freemasonry to be expensive, and not open to his ideas, he founded his own society which was to have a gradal system based on Freemasonry, but his own agenda.[3] His original name for the new order was Bund der Perfektibilisten, or Covenant of Perfectibility (Perfectibilists), later changing it because it sounded too strange.[4] On 1 May 1776 Weishaupt and four students formed the Perfectibilists, taking the Owl of Minerva as their symbol.[5][6] The members were to use aliases within the society. Weishaupt became Spartacus. Law students Massenhausen, Bauhof, Merz and Sutor became respectively Ajax, Agathon, Tiberius and Erasmus Roterodamus. Weishaupt later expelled Sutor for indolence.[7][8] It was not until April 1778 that the order became the Illuminatenorden, or Order of Illuminati, after Weishaupt had seriously contemplated the Bee order.[9]\r\n\r\nMassenhausen was initially the most active in expanding the society. Significantly, while studying in Munich shortly after the formation of the order, he recruited Xavier von Zwack, a former pupil of Weishaupt at the beginning of a significant administrative career. (At the time, he was in charge of the Bavarian National Lottery). Massenhausen's enthusiasm soon became a liability in the eyes of Weishaupt, often attempting to recruit unsuitable candidates. Later, his erratic love-life made him neglectful, and as Weishaupt passed control of the Munich group to Zwack, it became clear that Massenhausen had misappropriated subscriptions and intercepted correspondence between Weishaupt and Zwack. In 1778, Massenhausen graduated and took a post outside Bavaria, taking no further interest in the order. At this time, the order had a nominal membership of twelve.[7]\r\n\r\nWith the departure of Massenhausen, Zwack immediately applied himself to recruiting more mature and important recruits. Most prized by Weishaupt was Hertel, a childhood friend and a canon of the Munich Frauenkirche. By the end of summer 1778 the order had 27 members (still counting Massenhausen) in 5 commands; Munich (Athens), Ingolstadt (Eleusis), Ravensberg (Sparta), Freysingen (Thebes), and Eichstaedt (Erzurum).[7]\r\n\r\nDuring this early period, the order had three grades of Novice, Minerval, and Illuminated Minerval, of which only the Minerval grade involved a complicated ceremony. In this the candidate was given secret signs and a password. A system of mutual espionage kept Weishaupt informed of the activities and character of all his members, his favourites becoming members of the ruling council, or Areopagus. Some novices were permitted to recruit, becoming Insinuants. Christians of good character were expected, with Jews and Pagans specifically excluded, along with women, monks, and members of other secret societies. Favoured candidates were rich, docile, willing to learn, and aged 18–30.[10][11]\r\n\r\nTransition\r\nHaving, with difficulty, dissuaded some of his members from joining the Freemasons, Weishaupt decided to join the older order to acquire material to expand his own ritual. He was admitted to lodge \"Prudence\" of the Rite of Strict Observance early in February 1777. His progress through the three degrees of \"blue lodge\" masonry taught him nothing of the higher degrees he sought to exploit, but in the following year a priest called Abbé Marotti informed Zwack that these inner secrets rested on knowledge of the older religion and the primitive church. Zwack persuaded Weishaupt that their own order should enter into friendly relations with Freemasonry, and obtain the dispensation to set up their own lodge. At this stage (December 1778), the addition of the first three degrees of Freemasonry was seen as a secondary project.[12]\r\n\r\nWith little difficulty, a warrant was obtained from the Grand Lodge of Prussia called the Royal York for Friendship, and the new lodge was called Theodore of the Good Council, with the intention of flattering Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. It was founded in Munich on 21 March 1779, and quickly packed with Illuminati. The first master, a man called Radl, was persuaded to return home to Baden, and by July Weishaupt's order ran the lodge.[12]\r\n\r\nThe next step involved independence from their Grand Lodge. By establishing masonic relations with the Union lodge in Frankfurt, affiliated to the Premier Grand Lodge of England, lodge Theodore became independently recognised, and able to declare its independence. As a new mother lodge, it could now spawn lodges of its own. The recruiting drive amongst the Frankfurt masons also obtained the allegiance of Adolph Freiherr Knigge.[12]\r\n\r\nReform\r\nAdolph Knigge\r\n\r\nAdolph Freiherr Knigge, the most effective recruiter for the Illuminati\r\nKnigge was recruited late in 1780 at a convention of the Rite of Strict Observance by Costanzo Marchese di Costanzo, an infantry captain in the Bavarian army and a fellow Freemason. Knigge, still in his twenties, had already reached the highest initiatory grades of his order, and had arrived with his own grand plans for its reform. Disappointed that his scheme found no support, Knigge was immediately intrigued when Costanzo informed him that the order that he sought to create already existed. Knigge and three of his friends expressed a strong interest in learning more of this order, and Costanzo showed them material relating to the Minerval grade. The teaching material for the grade was \"liberal\" literature which was banned in Bavaria, but common knowledge in the Protestant German states. Knigge's three companions became disillusioned and had no more to do with Costanza, but Knigge's persistence was rewarded in November 1780 by a letter from Weishaupt. Knigge's connections, both within and outside of Freemasonry, made him an ideal recruit. Knigge, for his own part, was flattered by the attention, and drawn towards the order's stated aims of education and the protection of mankind from despotism. Weishaupt managed to acknowledge, and pledge to support, Knigge's interest in alchemy and the \"higher sciences\". Knigge replied to Weishaupt outlining his plans for the reform of Freemasonry as the Strict Observance began to question its own origins.[13]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt set Knigge the task of recruiting before he could be admitted to the higher grades of the order. Knigge accepted, on the condition that he was allowed to choose his own recruiting grounds. Many other masons found Knigge's description of the new masonic order attractive, and were enrolled in the Minerval grade of the Illuminati. Knigge appeared at this time to believe in the \"Most Serene Superiors\" which Weishaupt claimed to serve. His inability to articulate anything about the higher degrees of the order became increasingly embarrassing, but in delaying any help, Weishaupt gave him an extra task. Provided with material by Weishaupt, Knigge now produced pamphlets outlining the activities of the outlawed Jesuits, purporting to show how they continued to thrive and recruit, especially in Bavaria. Meanwhile, Knigge's inability to give his recruits any satisfactory response to questions regarding the higher grades was making his position untenable, and he wrote to Weishaupt to this effect. In January 1781, faced with the prospect of losing Knigge and his masonic recruits, Weishaupt finally confessed that his superiors and the supposed antiquity of the order were fictions, and the higher degrees had yet to be written.[13]\r\n\r\nIf Knigge had expected to learn the promised deep secrets of Freemasonry in the higher degrees of the Illuminati, he was surprisingly calm about Weishaupt's revelation. Weishaupt promised Knigge a free hand in the creation of the higher degrees, and also promised to send him his own notes. For his own part, Knigge welcomed the opportunity to use the order as a vehicle for his own ideas. His new approach would, he claimed, make the Illuminati more attractive to prospective members in the Protestant kingdoms of Germany. In November of 1781 the Areopagus advanced Knigge 50 florins to travel to Bavaria, which he did via Swabia and Franconia, meeting and enjoying the hospitality of other Illuminati on his journey.[14]\r\n\r\nInternal problems\r\nThe order had now developed profound internal divisions. The Eichstaedt command had formed an autonomous province in July 1780, and a rift was growing between Weishaupt and the Areopagus, who found him stubborn, dictatorial, and inconsistent. Knigge fitted readily into the role of peacemaker.[14]\r\n\r\nIn discussions with the Areopagus and Weishaupt, Knigge identified two areas which were problematic. Weishaupt's emphasis on the recruitment of university students meant that senior positions in the order often had to be filled by young men with little practical experience. Secondly, the anti-Jesuit ethos of the order at its inception had become a general anti-religious sentiment, which Knigge knew would be a problem in recruiting the senior Freemasons that the order now sought to attract. Knigge felt keenly the stifling grip of conservative Catholicism in Bavaria, and understood the anti-religious feelings that this produced in the liberal Illuminati, but he also saw the negative impression these same feelings would engender in Protestant states, inhibiting the spread of the order in greater Germany. Both the Areopagus and Weishaupt felt powerless to do anything less than give Knigge a free hand. He had the contacts within and outside of Freemasonry that they needed, and he had the skill as a ritualist to build their projected gradal structure, where they had ground to a halt at Illuminatus Minor, with only the Minerval grade below and the merest sketches of higher grades. The only restrictions imposed were the need to discuss the inner secrets of the highest grades, and the necessity of submitting his new grades for approval.[14]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the scheme to propagate Illuminatism as a legitimate branch of Freemasonry had stalled. While Lodge Theodore was now in their control, a chapter of \"Elect Masters\" attached to it only had one member from the order, and still had a constitutional superiority to the craft lodge controlled by the Illuminati. The chapter would be difficult to persuade to submit to the Areopagus, and formed a very real barrier to Lodge Theodore becoming the first mother-lodge of a new Illuminated Freemasonry. A treaty of alliance was signed between the order and the chapter, and by the end of January 1781 four daughter lodges had been created, but independence was not in the chapter's agenda.[14]\r\n\r\nCostanza wrote to the Royal York pointing out the discrepancy between the fees dispatched to their new Grand Lodge and the service they had received in return. The Royal York, unwilling to lose the revenue, offered to confer the \"higher\" secrets of Freemasonry on a representative that their Munich brethren would dispatch to Berlin. Costanza accordingly set off for Prussia on 4 April 1780, with instructions to negotiate a reduction in Theodore's fees while he was there. On the way, he managed to have an argument with a Frenchman on the subject of a lady with whom they were sharing a carriage. The Frenchman sent a message ahead to the king, some time before they reached Berlin, denouncing Costanza as a spy. He was only freed from prison with the help of the Grand Master of Royal York, and was expelled from Prussia having accomplished nothing.[14]\r\n\r\nNew system\r\nKnigge's initial plan to obtain a constitution from London would, they realised, have been seen through by the chapter. Until such time as they could take over other masonic lodges that their chapter could not control, they were for the moment content to rewrite the three degrees for the lodges which they administered.[14]\r\n\r\nOn 20 January 1782 Knigge tabulated his new system of grades for the order. These were arranged in three classes:\r\n\r\nClass I – The nursery, consisting of the Noviciate, the Minerval, and Illuminatus minor.\r\nClass II – The Masonic grades. The three \"blue lodge\" grades of Apprentice, Companion, and Master were separated from the higher \"Scottish\" grades of Scottish Novice and Scottish Knight.\r\nClass III – The Mysteries. The lesser mysteries were the grades of Priest and Prince, followed by the greater mysteries in the grades of Mage and King. It is unlikely that the rituals for the greater mysteries were ever written.[14][15]\r\nAttempts at expansion\r\nKnigge's recruitment from German Freemasonry was far from random. He targeted the masters and wardens, the men who ran the lodges, and were often able to place the entire lodge at the disposal of the Illuminati. In Aachen, Baron de Witte, master of Constancy lodge, caused every member to join the order. In this way, the order expanded rapidly in central and southern Germany, and obtained a foothold in Austria. Moving into the Spring of 1782, the handful of students that had started the order had swelled to about 300 members, only 20 of the new recruits being students.[16]\r\n\r\nIn Munich, the first half of 1782 saw huge changes in the government of Lodge Theodore. In February, Weishaupt had offered to split the lodge, with the Illuminati going their own way and the chapter taking any remaining traditionalists into their own continuation of Theodore. At this point, the chapter unexpectedly capitulated, and the Illuminati had complete control of lodge and chapter. In June, both lodge and chapter sent letters severing relations with Royal York, citing their own faithfulness in paying for their recognition, and Royal York's failure to provide any instruction into the higher grades. Their neglect of Costanza, failure to defend him from malicious charges or prevent his expulsion from Prussia, were also cited. They had made no effort to provide Costanza with the promised secrets, and the Munich masons now suspected that their brethren in Berlin relied on the mystical French higher grades which they sought to avoid. Lodge Theodore was now independent.[16]\r\n\r\nThe Rite of Strict Observance was now in a critical state. Its nominal leader was Prince Carl of Södermanland (later Charles XIII of Sweden), openly suspected of trying to absorb the rite into the Swedish Rite, which he already controlled. The German lodges looked for leadership to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Suspicion turned to open contempt when it transpired that Carl regarded the Stuart heir as the true Grand Master, and the lodges of the Strict Observance all but ignored their Grand Master. This impasse led to the Convent of Wilhelmsbad.[16]\r\n\r\nConvent of Wilhelmsbad\r\n\r\n\"Ruined\" castle built by Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel in the park at Wilhelmsbad, venue for the last convent of the Strict Observance\r\nDelayed from 15 October 1781, the last convention of the Strict Observance finally opened on 16 July 1782 in the spa town of Wilhelmsbad on the outskirts of (now part of) Hanau. Ostensibly a discussion of the future of the order, the 35 delegates knew that the Strict Observance in its current form was doomed, and that the Convent of Wilhelmsbad would be a struggle over the pieces between the German mystics, under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and their host Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, and the Martinists, under Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. The only dissenting voices to mystical higher grades were Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, who was horrified by Martinism, but whose proposed alternatives were as yet unformed, and Franz Dietrich von Ditfurth, a judge from Wetzlar and master of the Joseph of the Three Helmets lodge there, who was already a member of the Illuminati. Ditfurth publicly campaigned for a return to the basic three degrees of Freemasonry, which was the least likely outcome of the convention. The mystics already had coherent plans to replace the higher degrees.[16]\r\n\r\nThe lack of a coherent alternative to the two strains of mysticism allowed the Illuminati to present themselves as a credible option. Ditfurth, prompted and assisted by Knigge, who now had full authority to act for the order, became their spokesman. Knigge's original plan to propose an alliance between the two orders was rejected by Weishaupt, who saw no point in an alliance with a dying order. His new plan was to recruit the masons opposed to the \"Templar\" higher degree of the Strict Observance.[16]\r\n\r\nAt the convent, Ditfurth blocked the attempts of Willermoz and Hesse to introduce their own higher grades by insisting that full details of such degrees be revealed to the delegates. The frustration of the German mystics led to their enrolling Count Kollowrat with the Illuminati with a view to later affiliation. Ditfurth's own agenda was to replace all of the higher degrees with a single fourth degree, with no pretensions to further masonic revelations. Finding no support for his plan, he left the convent prematurely, writing to the Areopagus that he expected nothing good of the assembly.[16]\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to satisfy everybody, the Convent of Wilhelmsbad achieved little. They renounced the Templar origins of their ritual, while retaining the Templar titles, trappings and administrative structure. Charles of Hesse and Ferdinand of Brunswick remained at the head of the order, but in practice the lodges were almost independent. The Germans also adopted the name of the French order of Willermoz, les Chevaliers bienfaisants de la Cité sainte (Good Knights of the Holy City), and some Martinist mysticism was imported into the first three degrees, which were now the only essential degrees of Freemasonry. Crucially, individual lodges of the order were now allowed to fraternise with lodges of other systems. The new \"Scottish Grade\" introduced with the Lyon ritual of Willermoz was not compulsory, each province and prefecture was free to decide what, if anything, happened after the three craft degrees. Finally, in an effort to show that something had been achieved, the convent regulated at length on etiquette, titles, and a new numbering for the provinces.[16]\r\n\r\nAftermath of Wilhelmsbad\r\nWhat the Convent of Wilhelmsbad actually achieved was the demise of the Strict Observance. It renounced its own origin myth, along with the higher degrees which bound its highest and most influential members. It abolished the strict control which had kept the order united, and alienated many Germans who mistrusted Martinism. Bode, who was repelled by Martinism, immediately entered negotiations with Knigge, and finally joined the Illuminati in January 1783. Charles of Hesse joined the following month.[16]\r\n\r\nKnigge's first efforts at an alliance with the intact German Grand Lodges failed, but Weishaupt persisted. He proposed a new federation where all of the German lodges would practice an agreed, unified system in the essential three degrees of Freemasonry, and be left to their own devices as to which, if any, system of higher degrees they wished to pursue. This would be a federation of Grand Lodges, and members would be free to visit any of the \"blue\" lodges, in any jurisdiction. All lodge masters would be elected, and no fees would be paid to any central authority whatsoever. Groups of lodges would be subject to a \"Scottish Directorate\", composed of members delegated by lodges, to audit finances, settle disputes, and authorise new lodges. These in turn would elect Provincial Directorates, who would elect inspectors, who would elect the national director. This system would correct the current imbalance in German Freemasonry, where masonic ideals of equality were preserved only in the lower three \"symbolic\" degrees. The various systems of higher degrees were dominated by the elite who could afford researches in alchemy and mysticism. To Weishaupt and Knigge, the proposed federation was also a vehicle to propagate Illuminism throughout German Freemasonry. Their intention was to use their new federation, with its emphasis on the fundamental degrees, to remove all allegiance to Strict Observance, allowing the \"eclectic\" system of the Illuminati to take its place.[16]\r\n\r\nThe circular announcing the new federation outlined the faults of German freemasonry, that unsuitable men with money were often admitted on the basis of their wealth, that the corruption of civil society had infected the lodges. Having advocated the de-regulation of the higher grades of the German lodges, the Illuminati now announced their own, from their \"unknown Superiors\". Lodge Theodore, newly independent from Royal York, set themselves up as a provincial Grand Lodge. Knigge, in a letter to all the Royal York lodges, now accused that Grand Lodge of decadence. Their Freemasonry had allegedly been corrupted by the Jesuits. Strict Observance was now attacked as a creation of the Stuarts, devoid of all moral virtue. The Zinnendorf rite of the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany was suspect because its author was in league with the Swedes. This direct attack had the opposite effect to that intended by Weishaupt, it offended many of its readers. The Grand Lodge of the Grand Orient of Warsaw, which controlled Freemasonry in Poland and Lithuania, was happy to participate in the federation only as far as the first three degrees. Their insistence on independence had kept them from the Strict Observance, and would now keep them from the Illuminati, whose plan to annex Freemasonry rested on their own higher degrees. By the end of January 1783 the Illuminati's masonic contingent had seven lodges.[16]\r\n\r\nIt was not only the clumsy appeal of the Illuminati that left the federation short of members. Lodge Theodore was recently formed and did not command respect like the older lodges. Most of all, the Freemasons most likely to be attracted to the federation saw the Illuminati as an ally against the mystics and Martinists, but valued their own freedom too highly to be caught in another restrictive organisation. Even Ditfurth, the supposed representative of the Illuminati at Wilhelmsbad, had pursued his own agenda at the convent.[16]\r\n\r\nThe non-mystical Frankfurt lodges created an \"Eclectic Alliance\", which was almost indistinguishable in constitution and aims from the Illuminati's federation. Far from seeing this as a threat, after some discussion the Illuminati lodges joined the new alliance. Three Illuminati now sat on the committee charged with writing the new masonic statutes. Aside from strengthening relations between their three lodges, the Illuminati seem to have gained no advantage from this manoeuvre. Ditfurth, having found a masonic organisation that worked towards his own ambitions for Freemasonry, took little interest in the Illuminati after his adherence to the Eclectic Alliance. In reality, the creation of the Eclectic Alliance had undermined all of the subtle plans of the Illuminati to spread their own doctrine through Freemasonry.[16]\r\n\r\nZenith\r\nAlthough their hopes of mass recruitment through Freemasonry had been frustrated, the Illuminati continued to recruit well at an individual level. In Bavaria, the succession of Charles Theodore initially led to a liberalisation of attitudes and laws, but the clergy and courtiers, guarding their own power and privilege, persuaded the weak willed monarch to reverse his reforms, and Bavaria's repression of liberal thought returned. This reversal led to a general resentment of the monarch and the church among the educated classes, which provided a perfect recruiting ground for the Illuminati. A number of Freemasons from Prudence lodge, disaffected by the Martinist rites of the Chevaliers Bienfaisants, joined lodge Theodore, who set themselves up in a gardened mansion which contained their library of liberal literature.[17]\r\n\r\nIlluminati circles in the rest of Germany expanded. While some had only modest gains, the circle in Mainz almost doubled from 31 to 61 members. Reaction to state Catholicism led to gains in Austria, and footholds were obtained in Warsaw, Pressburg (Bratislava), Tyrol, Milan and Switzerland.[17]\r\n\r\nThe total number of verifiable members at the end of 1784 is around 650. Weishaupt and Hertel later claimed a figure of 2,500. The higher figure is largely explained by the inclusion of members of masonic lodges that the Illuminati claimed to control, but it is likely that the names of all the Illuminati are not known, and the true figure lies somewhere between 650 and 2,500. The importance of the order lay in its successful recruitment of the professional classes, churchmen, academics, doctors and lawyers, and its more recent acquisition of powerful benefactors. Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg with his brother and later successor August, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg governor of Erfurt, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (already mentioned), his chief assistant in masonic matters, Johann Friedrich von Schwarz, and Count Metternich of Koblenz were all enrolled. In Vienna, Count Brigido, governor of Galicia, Count Leopold Kolowrat, chancellor of Bohemia with his vice-chancellor Baron Kressel, Count Pálffy von Erdöd, chancellor of Hungary, Count Banffy, governor and provincial Grand Master of Transylvania, Count Stadion, ambassador to London, and Baron von Swieten, minister of public education, also joined.[17]\r\n\r\nThere were notable failures. Johann Kaspar Lavater, the Swiss poet and theologian, rebuffed Knigge. He did not believe the order's humanitarian and rationalist aims were achievable by secret means. He further believed that a society's drive for members would ultimately submerge its founding ideals. Christoph Friedrich Nicolai, the Berlin writer and bookseller, became disillusioned after joining. He found its aims chimeric, and thought that the use of Jesuit methods to achieve their aims was dangerous. He remained in the order, but took no part in recruitment.[17]\r\n\r\nConflict with Rosicrucians\r\nAt all costs, Weishaupt wished to keep the existence of the order secret from the Rosicrucians, who already had a considerable foothold in German Freemasonry. While clearly Protestant, the Rosicrucians were anything but anticlerical, pro-monarchic, and held views clearly conflicting with the Illuminati vision of a rationalist state run by philosophers and scientists. The Rosicrucians were not above promoting their own brand of mysticism with fraudulent seances. A conflict became inevitable as the existence of the Illuminati became more evident, and as prominent Rosicrucians, and mystics with Rosicrucian sympathies, were actively recruited by Knigge and other over-enthusiastic helpers. Kolowrat was already a high ranking Rosicrucian, and the mystic Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel had a very low opinion of the rationalist higher grades of the Illuminati.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Rosicrucians, under Johann Christoph von Wöllner, began a sustained attack on the Illuminati. Wöllner had a specially engineered room in which he convinced potential patrons of the effectiveness of Rosicrucian \"magic\", and his order had acquired effective control of the Three Globes and its attached lodges. Through this mouthpiece, the Illuminati were accused of Atheism and revolutionary tendencies. In April 1783 Frederick the Great informed Charles of Hesse that the Berlin lodges had documents belonging to the Minervals or Illuminati which contained appalling material, and asked if he had heard of them. All Berlin masons were now warned against the order, which was now accused of Socinianism, and of using the liberal writings of Voltaire and others, alongside the tolerance of Freemasonry, to undermine all religion. In November 1783 the Three Globes described the Illuminati as a masonic sect which sought to undermine Christianity and turn Freemasonry into a political system. Their final anathema, in November 1784, refused to recognise any Illuminati as Freemasons.[17]\r\n\r\nIn Austria, the Illuminati were blamed for anti-religious pamphlets that had recently appeared. The Rosicrucians spied on Joseph von Sonnenfels and other suspected Illuminati, and their campaign of denunciation within Freemasonry completely shut down Illuminati recruitment in Tyrol.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian Illuminati, whose existence was already known to the Rosicrucians from an informant, were further betrayed by the reckless actions of Ferdinand Maria Baader, an Areopagite who now joined the Rosicrucians. Shortly after his admission it was made known to his superiors that he was one of the Illuminati, and he was informed that he could not be a member of both organisations. His letter of resignation stated that the Rosicrucians did not possess secret knowledge, and ignored the truly Illuminated, specifically identifying Lodge Theodore as an Illuminati Lodge.[17]\r\n\r\nInternal dissent\r\nAs the Illuminati embraced Freemasonry and expanded outside Bavaria, the council of the Areopagites was replaced by an ineffective \"Council of Provincials\". The Areopagites, however, remained as powerful voices within the Order, and began again to bicker with Weishaupt as soon as Knigge left Munich. Weishaupt responded by privately slandering his perceived enemies in letters to his perceived friends.[17]\r\n\r\nMore seriously, Weishaupt succeeded in alienating Knigge. Weishaupt had ceded considerable power to Knigge in deputising him to write the ritual, power he now sought to regain. Knigge had elevated the Order from a tiny anti-clerical club to a large organisation, and felt that his work was under-acknowledged. Weishaupt's continuing anti-clericalism clashed with Knigge's mysticism, and recruitment of mystically inclined Freemasons was a cause of friction with Weishaupt and other senior Illuminati, such as Ditfurth. Matters came to a head over the grade of Priest. The consensus among many of the Illuminati was that the ritual was florid and ill-conceived, and the regalia puerile and expensive. Some refused to use it, others edited it. Weishaupt demanded that Knigge rewrite the ritual. Knigge pointed out that it was already circulated, with Weishaupt's blessing, as ancient. This fell on deaf ears. Weishaupt now claimed to other Illuminati that the Priest ritual was flawed because Knigge had invented it. Offended, Knigge now threatened to tell the world how much of the Illuminati ritual he had made up. Knigge's attempt to create a convention of the Areopagites proved fruitless, as most of them trusted him even less than they trusted Weishaupt. In July 1784 Knigge left the order by agreement, under which he returned all relevant papers, and Weishaupt published a retraction of all slanders against him.[17] In forcing Knigge out, Weishaupt deprived the order of its best theoretician, recruiter, and apologist.[15]\r\n\r\nDecline\r\nThe final decline of the Illuminati was brought about by the indiscretions of their own Minervals in Bavaria, and especially in Munich. In spite of efforts by their superiors to curb loose talk, politically dangerous boasts of power and criticism of monarchy caused the \"secret\" order's existence to become common knowledge, along with the names of many important members. The presence of Illuminati in positions of power now led to some public disquiet. There were Illuminati in many civic and state governing bodies. In spite of their small number, there were claims that success in a legal dispute depended on the litigant's standing with the order. The Illuminati were blamed for several anti-religious publications then appearing in Bavaria. Much of this criticism sprang from vindictiveness and jealousy, but it is clear that many Illuminati court officials gave preferential treatment to their brethren. In Bavaria, the energy of their two members of the Ecclesiastical Council had one of them elected treasurer. Their opposition to Jesuits resulted in the banned order losing key academic and church positions. In Ingolstat, the Jesuit heads of department were replaced by Illuminati.[18]\r\n\r\nAlarmed, Karl Theodor and his government banned all secret societies including the Illuminati.[19] A government edict dated March 2, 1785 \"seems to have been deathblow to the Illuminati in Bavaria\". Weishaupt had fled and documents and internal correspondence, seized in 1786 and 1787, were subsequently published by the government in 1787.[20] Von Zwack's home was searched and much of the group's literature was disclosed.[21]\r\n\r\nMany influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was the Order's second-in-command.[21] It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar.[22]\r\n\r\nBarruel and Robison\r\nBetween 1797 and 1798, Augustin Barruel's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism and John Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy publicised the theory that the Illuminati had survived and represented an ongoing international conspiracy. This included the claim that it was behind the French Revolution. Both books proved to be very popular, spurring reprints and paraphrases by others.[23] A prime example of this is Proofs of the Real Existence, and Dangerous Tendency, Of Illuminism by Reverend Seth Payson, published in 1802.[24] Some of the response to this was critical, for example Jean-Joseph Mounier's On the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, Free-Masons, and to the Illuminati on the Revolution of France.[25][26]\r\n\r\nThe works of Robison and Barruel made their way to the United States, and across New England, Reverend Jedidiah Morse and others gave sermons against the Illuminati. Their sermons were printed and the matter was followed in newspapers. Concern died down in the first decade of the 1800s, although it revived from time to time in the Anti-Masonic movement of the 1820s and 30s.[3]\r\n\r\nModern Illuminati\r\nSeveral recent and present-day fraternal organisations claim to be descended from the original Bavarian Illuminati and openly use the name \"Illuminati\". Some of these groups use a variation on the name \"The Illuminati Order\" in the name of their own organisations,[27][28] while others, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, have \"Illuminati\" as a level within their organisation's hierarchy. However, there is no evidence that these present-day groups have amassed significant political power or influence, and rather than trying to remain secret, they promote unsubstantiated links to the Bavarian Illuminati as a means of attracting membership.[19]\r\n\r\nPopular culture\r\nMain article: Illuminati in popular culture\r\nModern conspiracy theory\r\nMain article: New World Order (conspiracy theory) § Illuminati\r\nThe Illuminati did not long survive their suppression in Bavaria, and their further mischief and plottings in the work of Barruel and Robison must be considered as the invention of the writers.[3] However, writers such as Mark Dice,[29] David Icke, Texe Marrs, Jüri Lina and Morgan Gricar have argued that the Bavarian Illuminati have survived, possibly to this day.\r\n\r\nMany modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati.[30][31] Conspiracy theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati. Presidents of the United States are a common target for such claims.[32][33]\r\n\r\nOther theorists contend that a variety of historical events were orchestrated by the Illuminati, from the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and President John F. Kennedy's assassination to an alleged communist plot to hasten the New World Order by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry.[34][35]\r\n\r\nSome conspiracy theorists claim that the Illuminati observe Satanic rituals.[36][37]\r\n\r\nCriticism and satire of this theory has became so common that it is now a minor internet meme, with users identifying triangles in pieces of media, superimposing the Annuit cœptis over the triangle and then (usually in the form of an image macro) proclaiming that said work is a work of the Iluminati.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nNovels\r\nThe Illuminati, or fictitious modern groups called the Illuminati, play a central role in the plots of many novels, for example The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. They also make an appearance in Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. A mixture of historical fact and established conspiracy theory, or pure fiction, is used to portray them.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n^ Richard van Dülmen, The Society of Enlightenment (Polity Press 1992) p. 110\r\n^ René le Forestier, Les Illuminés de Bavière et la franc-maçonnerie allemande, Paris, 1914, pp. 453, 468-9, 507-8, 614-5\r\n^ a b c d Vernon Stauffer, New England and the Bavarian Illuminati, Columbia University Press, 1918, Chapter 3 The European Illuminati, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon, accessed 14 November 2015\r\n^ Weishaupt, Adam (1790).

In addition to his solo career, he is a member of D12 and (with Royce da 5'9\") half of the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States;[3] Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time,[4] calling him the King of Hip Hop.[5] Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 172 million albums, making him one of the world's best-selling artists.[6] As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1 million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million digital single certifications).[7][8][9]\r\n\r\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP; the commercially successful second album received his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases (2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show) were worldwide successes, with each certified diamond in US sales. Both won Best Rap Album Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010; both won Grammy Awards. Recovery was the bestselling album of 2010 worldwide, and the rapper's second international bestselling album of the year (his first was The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album (2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2) won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.\r\n\r\nEminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", the first rap artist to win the award.[10] Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Life and career\r\n1.1 1972–91: Early life\r\n1.2 1992–99: Early career, Infinite, and The Slim Shady LP\r\n1.3 2000–02: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\r\n1.4 2003–07: Encore and musical hiatus\r\n1.5 2008–09: Relapse and Refill\r\n1.6 2010–11: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\r\n1.7 2012–13: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\n1.8 2014–present: Shady XV and Southpaw\r\n2 Other ventures\r\n2.1 Shady Records and D12\r\n2.2 Acting career\r\n2.3 Memoirs\r\n2.4 Advertising and charity\r\n3 Artistry\r\n3.1 Influences and rapping technique\r\n3.2 Alter egos\r\n3.3 Collaborations and productions\r\n3.4 Comparisons with other artists\r\n4 Personal life\r\n4.1 Family\r\n4.2 Legal problems\r\n4.3 Drug problems\r\n4.4 Proof's death\r\n4.5 Alleged homophobia\r\n5 Legacy\r\n6 Discography\r\n7 Filmography\r\n8 Awards and nominations\r\n9 Tours\r\n10 Books\r\n11 Business ventures\r\n12 See also\r\n13 References\r\n13.1 Notes\r\n13.2 Further reading\r\n14 External links\r\nLife and career\r\n1972–91: Early life\r\nMathers was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri. He is the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr. (born June 30, 1951, and known as Bruce) and Deborah Rae Nelson (born January 6, 1955, and known as Debbie).[11][12][13] Eminem is of English, German, Scottish and Swiss descent.[14] Debbie was 14 when she met 18-year-old Bruce;[13] at age 17, she nearly died during her 73-hour labor.[15] Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas-Montana border before their separation. Bruce left the family, moving to California[16] and having two other children: Michael and Sarah (born c. 1982).[17] Debbie later had a son, Nathan Kane Samara, born February 3, 1986 and known as Nate.[13] During his childhood Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Missouri and Michigan, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri they lived in several places, including Saint Joseph, Savannah and Kansas City,[18] before settling in Warren, Michigan when Eminem was eleven.[16][19] As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father; according to Debbie, all came back marked \"Return to sender.\"[16] Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but \"a bit of a loner\" who was often bullied. One bully, De'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem in the head; Debbie Nelson filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year.[15]\r\n\r\nEminem spent much of his youth in a lower-middle-class, primarily African-American Detroit neighborhood.[16] He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by African-American youths several times.[16] As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic-book artist before discovering hip hop.[20] Eminem heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) at age nine on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronald (Ronnie) Polkinghorn. When Polkinghorn committed suicide ten years later, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral.[16]\r\n\r\nHis home life was seldom stable; Eminem frequently fought with his mother, who was described by a social worker as having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality.\" When her son became famous Debbie bristled at suggestions that she was a less-than-ideal mother, contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Ann (Kim) Scott to stay at their home; several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Kim.[15] After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades,[21] he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although he was interested in English, he never explored literature (preferring comic books) and disliked math and social studies.[22] Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.[16]\r\n\r\nAt age 14, he began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M,\" which evolved into \"Eminem\".[2][15] Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.[23] On Saturdays they attended open-mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, considered ground-zero for the Detroit rap scene.[16] Struggling to succeed in a predominantly African-American industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences.[2][24][25] When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable.[22] Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.[22]\r\n\r\n1992–99: Early career, Infinite, and The Slim Shady LP\r\nAs Eminem's reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups; the first of these was the New Jacks. After they disbanded he joined Soul Intent, who released a single in 1995 featuring Proof.[2] The two rappers formed D12, a six-member ensemble resembling a Wu-Tang-style collective more than a regularly performing group.[16] Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.[15]\r\n\r\nEminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass' FBT Productions, recording his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label.[26] One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he would later be known.[27] Infinite was largely ignored by Detroit disc jockeys, and the feedback he did receive (\"Why don't you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.[16] At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and their house was robbed several times.[16] He cooked and washed dishes for the minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores.[28] Described by his former boss as becoming a model employee, he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth.[15] He was once fired shortly before Christmas, and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\"[16] After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt.[2] By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert’s Lodge for the last time, and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.[15]\r\n\r\nEminem onstage in a white T-shirt\r\nEminem in Germany, 1999\r\nEminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character, \"a drug-dealing, bloodthirsty thug who spits furious rhymes about murder, rape, drugs and living by the law of the urban jungle\", allowed him to express his anger.[15] In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment.[16] The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism.[2] Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.[29]\r\n\r\nAfter he was evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics (an annual, nationwide battle rap competition). He placed second, and Interscope Records staff in attendance sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\" Although he was criticized by associates for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.\"[16] Eminem, who had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\"[30] He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.[31]\r\n\r\nEminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year),[32] he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage.[33][34] Its popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body, also \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. Guilty Conscience marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What's the Difference\" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore, and \"Old Time's Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse), and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums.[35] The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\r\n\r\n2000–02: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\r\n\r\nEminem and Proof at Voodoo Experience in October 2000\r\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1,760,000 copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album.[36][37] The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Fred Durst and Carson Daly).[38] In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem.[39] In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido's \"Thank You\") Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).[24] Q magazine called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song of all time,[40] and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey.[41] The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone magazine's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.[42] In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source magazine.[29] The Marshall Mathers LP has been certified 11× platinum by the RIAA.\r\n\r\nEminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001,[43] with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem.[44] Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \"Stan\" that would have been memorable in any context.\"[45] On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue).[46] In 2001 Eminem appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube[47] and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit,[48] headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit.\r\n\r\nThe Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week.[32] The album's single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show (certified 10× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America) examines the effects of the rapper's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP.[49] L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show‍ '​s extensive use of obscenity and called the rapper \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album.[50] The Eminem Show was the best-selling album of 2002.[51]\r\n\r\n2003–07: Encore and musical hiatus\r\nEminem onstage, with blond hair and wearing a suit\r\nOn the Anger Management Tour promoting Encore\r\nOn December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States.[52] The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.[53]\r\n\r\nEncore, released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs about Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after \"Just Lose It\"'s release, Jackson phoned the Los Angeles-based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song Eminem says, \"That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho\". Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder (who described it as \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\")[54] and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\").[54] The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period.[55] \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\"[56] Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson.[57] In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.[58]\r\n\r\nDespite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\". The song criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush\".[59] On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet.[60] In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2\". After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president.[61]\r\n\r\nIn 2005, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several multi-platinum albums. Rumors began early in the year about a double album to be released late that year, entitled The Funeral;[62] the greatest hits album, entitled Curtain Call: The Hits, was released in December. In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. The day of Curtain Call: The Hits‍ '​s release, Eminem appeared on WKQI's \"Mojo in the Morning\" show. Denying that he was retiring, he suggested he would take a break as an artist: \"I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call', because this could be the final thing. We don't know.\"[63] The following year, Eminem released Eminem Presents: The Re-Up on Shady Records.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 the rapper was ranked 58th in Bernard Goldberg's book, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.[64] Goldberg cited a 2001 column by Bob Herbert of The New York Times, in which Herbert wrote \"In Eminem's world, all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them\",[65] and the song \"No One's Iller\" from the Slim Shady EP as examples of the rapper's misogyny.[66] That summer Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years, with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and The Alchemist. In August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\".[67] Curtain Call: The Hits was released December 6, 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment.[68] During its first week it sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US, and was Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200.[69] The album has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.[70]\r\n\r\nIn September 2007 Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I'm always working – I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\"[71]\r\n\r\n2008–09: Relapse and Refill\r\nEminem onstage in a white shirt, gray jacket and baseball cap\r\nWith D12 in May 2009\r\nEminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff.\"[72] Interscope confirmed that a new album[73] would be released in spring 2009.[74] In December 2008 the rapper provided a few more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let's just leave it at that.\"[75]\r\n\r\nAccording to a March 5, 2009 press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7.[76] Although Relapse did not sell as well as the rapper's previous albums, it was a commercial success which received positive reviews and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. Relapse was named one of the top albums of 2009, and has sold more than five million copies worldwide. During the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Sacha Baron Cohen descended on the audience in an angel costume. He landed buttocks-first on Eminem, who stormed out of the ceremony; three days later, the rapper said that the stunt had been staged.[77] On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year.[78] Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:\r\n\r\nI want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.[79]\r\n\r\n2010–11: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\r\nEminem and Rihanna onstage in front of three large theater screens\r\nSinging \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna at the 2010 E3 Expo Party\r\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"RECOVERY\" with a link to his website. According to the rapper:\r\n\r\nI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.[80]\r\n\r\nHis seventh album was released on June 18.[80] In the US Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart.[81][82] Eminem's sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.[83][84]\r\n\r\nBillboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums.[85] Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history.[86] Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4.[87] \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top.[88] Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969).[89] Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies.[90] Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002's bestseller The Eminem Show to give the rapper two worldwide year-end number-one albums.[91][92] With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.[93]\r\n\r\nHe appeared at the 2010 BET Awards,[94] performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B, and performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city.[95] BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century.[96] He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses.[97] Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV[98] and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX.[99] He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective.[100] In December 2010, the \"Great Eminem Recovery\" was number one on Billboard‍ '​s Top 25 Music Moments of 2010.[101] He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey.[102] That month it was announced that \"Space Bound\" would be the fourth single from Recovery, with a music video featuring former porn star Sasha Grey;[103][104] the video was released June 24 on the iTunes Store.[105]\r\n\r\nEminem onstage, in front of automobile front ends\r\nPerforming in 2011\r\nIn 2010, Eminem again began collaborating with Royce da 5'9\" on their first EP as Bad Meets Evil; the duo formed in 1999. The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011.[106] Eminem was featured on Royce da 5'9\"'s \"Writer's Block\", released on April 8, 2011.[107] On May 3 they released the lead single \"Fast Lane\" from their upcoming EP, and a music video was filmed.[108] In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums.[109] With more than 60 million \"likes\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson.[110] Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period.[111] Early in 2011 he leaked \"2.0 Boys\", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January, and performed it in April.[112] Bad Meets Evil released their next single, \"Lighters\", on July 6 and its music video in late August.[113][114] On August 6, Eminem performed several songs from throughout his career at Lollapalooza with the artists who had been featured on each song.[115]\r\n\r\n2012–13: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\nMain article: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\nEminem announced on May 24, 2012 that he was working on his next album,[116] scheduled for release the following year.[117] Without a title or release date, it was included on a number of \"Most Anticipated Albums of 2013\" lists (including MTV); Complex Magazine ranked it sixth, and XXL listed it fifth.[118]\r\n\r\nHe talked about the album on June 30, 2012, with DJ Whoo Kid on Shade 45; the material was taking shape, and Dr. Dre would be involved.[119] On August 30, Slaughterhouse member Royce da 5'9\" said about it: \"I'm not so sure how the world is going to respond from some of the things that I've heard from him.\"[citation needed] Friend and fellow rapper 50 Cent was confirmed as appearing on the album.[120] Eminem appeared on Pink's \"Here Comes The Weekend\", from The Truth About Love.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 2013, Shady Records president and Eminem manager Paul Rosenberg announced that the rapper's eighth album would be released after Memorial Day. \"We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's been working on it for some time,\" said Rosenberg. \"It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to see what else lines up.\" The album remained untitled.[121] On March 22, Dr. Dre said that he worked with Eminem on the album and it was nearly finished;[122] No I.D. was confirmed as producer.[123]\r\n\r\nOn August 14 \"Survival\", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premièred in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts. According to a press release, the first single from Eminem's eighth album would be released soon.[124][125] During the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced that the album would be entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (following The Marshall Mathers LP) and was scheduled for release on November 5.[126]\r\n\r\nEminem onstate in T-shirt, shorts and baseball cap\r\nAt the 2014 Lollapalooza in Chicago\r\nIts lead single, \"Berzerk\", was released on August 25 and debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three more singles followed: \"Survival\" (appearing on the Call of Duty: Ghosts trailer),[127] \"Rap God\" and \"The Monster\" (with Rihanna).\r\n\r\nThe album was released on November 5 by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records and Interscope Records. Its standard version had 16 tracks, and the deluxe version included a second disc with five additional tracks. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was Eminem's seventh album to debut atop the Billboard 200, and had the year's second-largest first-week sales.[128][129] The rapper was the first artist since The Beatles to have four singles in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100.[130][131][132]\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom The Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The first American artist with seven consecutive UK number-one albums, he is tied with The Beatles for second place for the most consecutive chart-topping UK albums.[133][134][135] The album secured Eminem's position as Canada's best-selling artist, and was 2013's best-selling album.[136]\r\n\r\nOn November 3 Eminem was named the first YouTube Music Awards Artist of the Year,[137] and a week later he received the Global Icon Award at the 2013 MTV EMA Music Awards.[138] On June 10, it was announced that the rapper was the first artist to receive two digital diamond certifications – sales and streams of 10 million and above – by the RIAA (for \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\").[139] On July 11 and 12, Eminem played two concerts in Wembley Stadium.[140] At the 57th Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \"The Monster\".[141][142]\r\n\r\n2014–present: Shady XV and Southpaw\r\nIn June 2014 Eminem and Rosenberg began using the hashtag #SHADYXV on social-networking sites, and the rapper wore a T-shirt with the hashtag onstage. According to an August 25 press release on Eminem's website, the hashtag was the name of an upcoming Shady Records compilation: Shady XV. That day, the first single from the album (\"Guts Over Fear\", featuring singer-songwriter Sia Furler)[143] was released and the album's track list was released on October 29.[144] Shady Records released a cypher to promote the album, in which Eminem did a seven-minute freestyle. \"Detroit Vs. Everybody\" (the album's second single), with Eminem, Dej Loaf, Royce da 5'9\", Danny Brown, Big Sean and Trick-Trick, was released on November 11.[145] Shady XV, released on November 24 during Black Friday week,[146] consists of one greatest-hits disc and one disc of new material by Shady Records artists such as D12, Slaughterhouse, Bad Meets Evil and Yelawolf. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 138,000 copies in the United States.[147]\r\n\r\nThe Official Eminem Box Set, a career-spanning, 10-disc vinyl box set, was released on March 12, 2015. The set includes seven of Eminem's eight studio albums (excluding Infinite), the 8 Mile soundtrack, the compilation Eminem Presents: The Re-Up, and the greatest hits collection Curtain Call: The Hits.[148] Early in the year, it was announced that he would appear on Tech N9ne's \"Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2)\".[149] The song, also featuring Krizz Kaliko, was released on April 20. Eminem also appeared on Yelawolf's \"Best Friend\", the single from Love Story.\r\n\r\nEminem is the executive producer of the soundtrack on the sports drama Southpaw, with Shady Records. The first single from the soundtrack called 'Phenomenal' was released on June 2, 2015.[150] Another single, 'Kings Never Die' by Eminem featuring Gwen Stefani, was released on July 10, 2015 on YouTube via Eminem's Vevo account.[151] Eminem was the first interview of Zane Lowe in Beats 1. The interview streamed online on the Beats 1 radio on [152] July 1, 2015. Eminem appeared on the public access show Only in Monroe, produced in Monroe, Michigan, and was interviewed by guest host Stephen Colbert for an episode that aired July 1, 2015. The rapper, who was referred to throughout the interview by his legal name Marshall Mathers, sang snippets of Bob Seger songs at Colbert's prompting and briefly discussed Southpaw.[153]\r\n\r\nOther ventures\r\nShady Records and D12\r\nMain articles: Shady Records and D12\r\nAfter Eminem's multi-platinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; the rapper and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.[21]\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater.[154] While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan.[155] In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released.[156] The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use). \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex, and renamed \"Purple Hills\". It was a hit but the album's third single, \"Fight Music\", was not as successful.[157]\r\n\r\nAfter their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit single \"My Band\".[156] According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he's busy doing his thing\".[158] D12 released a 2011 mixtape entitled Return of the Dozen Volume 2, with Eminem on one song (\"Fame\"); the rapper was not on the group's previous mixtape, Return of the Dozen.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.[159]\r\n\r\nActing career\r\nAfter a small role in the 2001 film The Wash, Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the quasi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. According to the rapper, it is a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running #1 hip hop single in history).[160] Eminem was absent from the ceremony, and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.[161]\r\n\r\nThe rapper has voiced the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof (as an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer) and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show (currently available on DVD).[162] He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel,[163] and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper.[164] Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People.\r\n\r\nHe played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera.[165] Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit.[166] The rapper had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film, The Interview; during an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem comes out.[167]\r\n\r\nMemoirs\r\nEminem's autobiography, The Way I Am, was published October 21, 2008. Detailing his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak and depression, it includes stories of his rise to fame, commentary about past controversies and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady.\"[168] An autobiography of the rapper's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.\r\n\r\nAdvertising and charity\r\nEminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton's Brisk iced tea, the rapper is a claymation figure.[169] In the second, a two-minute ad – the longest in Super Bowl history at the time – for the 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.[170][171]\r\n\r\nHe established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney.[172]\r\n\r\nArtistry\r\nInfluences and rapping technique\r\nEminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham,[173] Kool G Rap,[174] Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane,[174] Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run–D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.[175] In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats\".[176] In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter,[177] connecting with his audience,[178] carrying a concept over a series of albums,[179] complex rhyme schemes,[180] bending words so they rhyme,[181] multisyllabic rhymes,[174] many rhymes to a bar,[182] complex rhythms,[183] clear enunciation[184] and the use of melody[185] and syncopation.[186] Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics,[187] being a \"workaholic\"[188] and \"stacking\" vocals.[189]\r\n\r\nAlter egos\r\nThe rapper uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. Eminem's best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP. In this persona his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist.[190] Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album's theme.[191] Another character is Ken Kaniff, a homosexual who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, created a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing the rapper.\r\n\r\nCollaborations and productions\r\nSee also: Eminem production discography and Eminem discography § Guest appearances\r\nAlthough Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes' \"Touch It\" remix at the June 27, 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon's single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne's hit \"Drop the World\", and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent's Street King Immortal).\r\n\r\nEminem was the executive producer of D12's first two albums (Devil's Night and D12 World), Obie Trice's Cheers and Second Round's on Me and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre.[192] He has produced songs for other rappers, such as Jadakiss' \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z's \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks' \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo's \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick's \"Welcome 2 Detroit\", and Xzibit's \"My Name\" and \"Don't Approach Me\".[193] Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass,[194] and the rapper co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004 Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac's posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur's mother, Afeni.[195] He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John,[196] \"The Cross\" from the Nas album God's Son[197] and eight tracks on Obie Trice's 2006 Second Round's on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\").[198] The rapper produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\"),[199] and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\r\n\r\nEminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats.[200] One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King.[200] After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\"[201]\r\n\r\nComparisons with other artists\r\nAs a lyricist and a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared to Bob Dylan.[202] Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem, and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him.[203]\r\n\r\nEminem and Christian hip hop artist KJ-52 have been compared to each other, with KJ-52 called his \"Christian counterpart\".[204] KJ-52's single, \"Dear Slim\", was controversial with Eminem fans when it appeared on Total Request Live. Although he said the song was not intended to be disrespectful,[205] KJ-52 received hate mail and the song was number 26 on VH1's Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop list.[206]\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nFamily\r\nEminem has been scrutinized, as a rapper and personally.[37] The rapper was married twice to Kimberly Anne (Kim) Scott. He met Kim in high school; he was 15 and she was 13 when he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J's \"I'm Bad.\"[207] Kim and her twin sister, Dawn, had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989. Their daughter, Hailie, was born on December 25, 1995; they married in 1999, divorcing in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April,[208] agreeing to joint custody of Hailie.[209] He has also adopted Alaina, Dawn's daughter and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship.[210][211] In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had reconciled.[212] He had legal custody of his younger half-brother, Nate Kane.[213] In his 2014 song \"Headlights\", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for, his mother.[214]\r\n\r\nLegal problems\r\nIn 1999 Eminem's mother sued him for about $10 million for slandering her on The Slim Shady LP, receiving about $1,600 in damages in 2001.[215] Eminem was arrested on June 3, 2000 during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested for assaulting bouncer John Guerrera in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw Guerrera kiss his wife.[216][217] Eminem recreated the Guerrera assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. The rapper, charged with possession of a concealed weapon and assault, pled guilty and received two years' probation; Guerrera's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.[218] On July 7, 2000 Kim attempted suicide, slashing her wrists,[219] and later sued Eminem for defamation after he described her violent death in \"Kim\".[217]\r\n\r\nOn October 26, 2000, the rapper was scheduled to perform at Toronto's Skydome when Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. \"I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women,\" he said. Flaherty said he was \"disgusted\" when he read the lyrics of \"Kill You\", which includes the lines \"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?\" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges be brought against the rapper for advocating violence against women in his lyrics.[220] Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, \"Being offensive is Eminem's job description\",[221] and the rapper's Toronto concert went on as planned.[222]\r\n\r\nSanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing him in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song which portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" him and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; the judge, who rapped the verdict, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.[223] On June 28, 2001 Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and fined about $2,000 on weapons charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.[224]\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \"Kill You\" was from his instrumental \"Pulsion\".[225] Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted, and any remaining copies destroyed. A trial date was set for June 2004, and the case was later settled.[226]\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2003 the United States Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem threatened President George W. Bush[227] in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore‍ '​s deluxe-edition bonus disc, with altered lyrics.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's iTunes.[228][229] The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.[230]\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.[231]\r\n\r\nDrug problems\r\nEminem has spoken about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium.[232] According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first \"sobered up\" in 2002.[233] During the production of 8 Mile, the rapper, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount [...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. The rapper's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg), and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me – it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was he: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"[22]\r\n\r\nHis struggle with drugs climaxed with a December 2007 methadone overdose. Eminem had first bought methadone from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". The rapper continued to buy more, until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully detoxed. When he tore his meniscus \"after falling asleep for literally 10 minutes,\" he had surgery; after he came home he had a seizure and relapsed within three weeks. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running, and became sober on April 20, 2008. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him.[22]\r\n\r\nProof's death\r\nOn April 11, 2006 Eminem's best friend, Deshaun (Proof) Holton, was fatally shot in the head and chest by club bouncer Mario Etheridge at the CCC Club on 8 Mile Road in Detroit after Proof shot Keith Bender, Jr. (Etheridge's cousin) to death.[234] Proof was brought by car to St. John Health's Conner Creek Campus (an outpatient emergency-treatment facility), where he was pronounced dead on arrival. On April 19, Eminem, D12, 50 Cent and thousands of others attended Proof's funeral at the Fellowship Chapel in Detroit.[235] Eminem and former Shady Records artist Obie Trice (a fellow Detroit native) eulogized the rapper.[236] He recorded two songs about Proof's death on Recovery (\"Going Through Changes\" and \"You're Never Over\"), and mentions Proof in \"Deja Vu\", \"Beautiful\" and \"Cinderella Man\". In 2010 \"Difficult\", a tribute to Proof, was leaked online.[237]\r\n\r\nAlleged homophobia\r\nSome of Eminem's lyrics have been considered homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country.[238] Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:[239]\r\n\r\nCooper: Some of the lyrics, like, you know, in the song \"Criminal\" you say \"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez, Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress—hate fags? The answer's 'yes'\".\r\nEminem: Yeah, this scene I came up in. That word was thrown around so much, you know, \"faggot\" was like thrown around constantly to each other, like in battling.\r\nCooper: Do you not like gay people?\r\nEminem: No, I don't have any problem with nobody. You know what I mean? I'm just like whatever.\r\nThe rapper is a friend of Elton John.[240] When asked his opinion in a New York Times interview of the legalization of same-sex marriage in Michigan, Eminem replied: \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell?

In addition to his solo career, he is a member of D12 and (with Royce da 5'9\") half of the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States;[3] Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time,[4] calling him the King of Hip Hop.[5] Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 172 million albums, making him one of the world's best-selling artists.[6] As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1 million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million digital single certifications).[7][8][9]\r\n\r\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP; the commercially successful second album received his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases (2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show) were worldwide successes, with each certified diamond in US sales. Both won Best Rap Album Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010; both won Grammy Awards. Recovery was the bestselling album of 2010 worldwide, and the rapper's second international bestselling album of the year (his first was The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album (2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2) won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.\r\n\r\nEminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", the first rap artist to win the award.[10] Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage.\r\n\r\nContents  [hide] \r\n1 Life and career\r\n1.1 1972–91: Early life\r\n1.2 1992–99: Early career, Infinite, and The Slim Shady LP\r\n1.3 2000–02: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\r\n1.4 2003–07: Encore and musical hiatus\r\n1.5 2008–09: Relapse and Refill\r\n1.6 2010–11: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\r\n1.7 2012–13: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\n1.8 2014–present: Shady XV and Southpaw\r\n2 Other ventures\r\n2.1 Shady Records and D12\r\n2.2 Acting career\r\n2.3 Memoirs\r\n2.4 Advertising and charity\r\n3 Artistry\r\n3.1 Influences and rapping technique\r\n3.2 Alter egos\r\n3.3 Collaborations and productions\r\n3.4 Comparisons with other artists\r\n4 Personal life\r\n4.1 Family\r\n4.2 Legal problems\r\n4.3 Drug problems\r\n4.4 Proof's death\r\n4.5 Alleged homophobia\r\n5 Legacy\r\n6 Discography\r\n7 Filmography\r\n8 Awards and nominations\r\n9 Tours\r\n10 Books\r\n11 Business ventures\r\n12 See also\r\n13 References\r\n13.1 Notes\r\n13.2 Further reading\r\n14 External links\r\nLife and career\r\n1972–91: Early life\r\nMathers was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri. He is the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr. (born June 30, 1951, and known as Bruce) and Deborah Rae Nelson (born January 6, 1955, and known as Debbie).[11][12][13] Eminem is of English, German, Scottish and Swiss descent.[14] Debbie was 14 when she met 18-year-old Bruce;[13] at age 17, she nearly died during her 73-hour labor.[15] Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas-Montana border before their separation. Bruce left the family, moving to California[16] and having two other children: Michael and Sarah (born c. 1982).[17] Debbie later had a son, Nathan Kane Samara, born February 3, 1986 and known as Nate.[13] During his childhood Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Missouri and Michigan, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri they lived in several places, including Saint Joseph, Savannah and Kansas City,[18] before settling in Warren, Michigan when Eminem was eleven.[16][19] As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father; according to Debbie, all came back marked \"Return to sender.\"[16] Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but \"a bit of a loner\" who was often bullied. One bully, De'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem in the head; Debbie Nelson filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year.[15]\r\n\r\nEminem spent much of his youth in a lower-middle-class, primarily African-American Detroit neighborhood.[16] He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by African-American youths several times.[16] As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic-book artist before discovering hip hop.[20] Eminem heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) at age nine on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronald (Ronnie) Polkinghorn. When Polkinghorn committed suicide ten years later, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral.[16]\r\n\r\nHis home life was seldom stable; Eminem frequently fought with his mother, who was described by a social worker as having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality.\" When her son became famous Debbie bristled at suggestions that she was a less-than-ideal mother, contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Ann (Kim) Scott to stay at their home; several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Kim.[15] After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades,[21] he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although he was interested in English, he never explored literature (preferring comic books) and disliked math and social studies.[22] Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.[16]\r\n\r\nAt age 14, he began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M,\" which evolved into \"Eminem\".[2][15] Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.[23] On Saturdays they attended open-mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, considered ground-zero for the Detroit rap scene.[16] Struggling to succeed in a predominantly African-American industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences.[2][24][25] When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable.[22] Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.[22]\r\n\r\n1992–99: Early career, Infinite, and The Slim Shady LP\r\nAs Eminem's reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups; the first of these was the New Jacks. After they disbanded he joined Soul Intent, who released a single in 1995 featuring Proof.[2] The two rappers formed D12, a six-member ensemble resembling a Wu-Tang-style collective more than a regularly performing group.[16] Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.[15]\r\n\r\nEminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass' FBT Productions, recording his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label.[26] One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he would later be known.[27] Infinite was largely ignored by Detroit disc jockeys, and the feedback he did receive (\"Why don't you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.[16] At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and their house was robbed several times.[16] He cooked and washed dishes for the minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores.[28] Described by his former boss as becoming a model employee, he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth.[15] He was once fired shortly before Christmas, and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\"[16] After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt.[2] By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert’s Lodge for the last time, and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.[15]\r\n\r\nEminem onstage in a white T-shirt\r\nEminem in Germany, 1999\r\nEminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character, \"a drug-dealing, bloodthirsty thug who spits furious rhymes about murder, rape, drugs and living by the law of the urban jungle\", allowed him to express his anger.[15] In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment.[16] The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism.[2] Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.[29]\r\n\r\nAfter he was evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics (an annual, nationwide battle rap competition). He placed second, and Interscope Records staff in attendance sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\" Although he was criticized by associates for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.\"[16] Eminem, who had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\"[30] He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.[31]\r\n\r\nEminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year),[32] he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage.[33][34] Its popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body, also \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. Guilty Conscience marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What's the Difference\" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore, and \"Old Time's Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse), and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums.[35] The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\r\n\r\n2000–02: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\r\n\r\nEminem and Proof at Voodoo Experience in October 2000\r\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1,760,000 copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album.[36][37] The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Fred Durst and Carson Daly).[38] In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem.[39] In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido's \"Thank You\") Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).[24] Q magazine called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song of all time,[40] and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey.[41] The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone magazine's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.[42] In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source magazine.[29] The Marshall Mathers LP has been certified 11× platinum by the RIAA.\r\n\r\nEminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001,[43] with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem.[44] Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \"Stan\" that would have been memorable in any context.\"[45] On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue).[46] In 2001 Eminem appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube[47] and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit,[48] headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit.\r\n\r\nThe Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week.[32] The album's single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show (certified 10× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America) examines the effects of the rapper's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP.[49] L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show‍ '​s extensive use of obscenity and called the rapper \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album.[50] The Eminem Show was the best-selling album of 2002.[51]\r\n\r\n2003–07: Encore and musical hiatus\r\nEminem onstage, with blond hair and wearing a suit\r\nOn the Anger Management Tour promoting Encore\r\nOn December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States.[52] The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.[53]\r\n\r\nEncore, released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs about Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after \"Just Lose It\"'s release, Jackson phoned the Los Angeles-based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song Eminem says, \"That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho\". Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder (who described it as \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\")[54] and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\").[54] The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period.[55] \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\"[56] Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson.[57] In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.[58]\r\n\r\nDespite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\". The song criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush\".[59] On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet.[60] In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2\". After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president.[61]\r\n\r\nIn 2005, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several multi-platinum albums. Rumors began early in the year about a double album to be released late that year, entitled The Funeral;[62] the greatest hits album, entitled Curtain Call: The Hits, was released in December. In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. The day of Curtain Call: The Hits‍ '​s release, Eminem appeared on WKQI's \"Mojo in the Morning\" show. Denying that he was retiring, he suggested he would take a break as an artist: \"I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call', because this could be the final thing. We don't know.\"[63] The following year, Eminem released Eminem Presents: The Re-Up on Shady Records.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 the rapper was ranked 58th in Bernard Goldberg's book, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.[64] Goldberg cited a 2001 column by Bob Herbert of The New York Times, in which Herbert wrote \"In Eminem's world, all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them\",[65] and the song \"No One's Iller\" from the Slim Shady EP as examples of the rapper's misogyny.[66] That summer Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years, with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and The Alchemist. In August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\".[67] Curtain Call: The Hits was released December 6, 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment.[68] During its first week it sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US, and was Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200.[69] The album has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.[70]\r\n\r\nIn September 2007 Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I'm always working – I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\"[71]\r\n\r\n2008–09: Relapse and Refill\r\nEminem onstage in a white shirt, gray jacket and baseball cap\r\nWith D12 in May 2009\r\nEminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff.\"[72] Interscope confirmed that a new album[73] would be released in spring 2009.[74] In December 2008 the rapper provided a few more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let's just leave it at that.\"[75]\r\n\r\nAccording to a March 5, 2009 press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7.[76] Although Relapse did not sell as well as the rapper's previous albums, it was a commercial success which received positive reviews and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. Relapse was named one of the top albums of 2009, and has sold more than five million copies worldwide. During the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Sacha Baron Cohen descended on the audience in an angel costume. He landed buttocks-first on Eminem, who stormed out of the ceremony; three days later, the rapper said that the stunt had been staged.[77] On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year.[78] Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:\r\n\r\nI want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.[79]\r\n\r\n2010–11: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\r\nEminem and Rihanna onstage in front of three large theater screens\r\nSinging \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna at the 2010 E3 Expo Party\r\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"RECOVERY\" with a link to his website. According to the rapper:\r\n\r\nI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.[80]\r\n\r\nHis seventh album was released on June 18.[80] In the US Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart.[81][82] Eminem's sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.[83][84]\r\n\r\nBillboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums.[85] Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history.[86] Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4.[87] \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top.[88] Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969).[89] Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies.[90] Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002's bestseller The Eminem Show to give the rapper two worldwide year-end number-one albums.[91][92] With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.[93]\r\n\r\nHe appeared at the 2010 BET Awards,[94] performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B, and performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city.[95] BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century.[96] He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses.[97] Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV[98] and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX.[99] He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective.[100] In December 2010, the \"Great Eminem Recovery\" was number one on Billboard‍ '​s Top 25 Music Moments of 2010.[101] He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey.[102] That month it was announced that \"Space Bound\" would be the fourth single from Recovery, with a music video featuring former porn star Sasha Grey;[103][104] the video was released June 24 on the iTunes Store.[105]\r\n\r\nEminem onstage, in front of automobile front ends\r\nPerforming in 2011\r\nIn 2010, Eminem again began collaborating with Royce da 5'9\" on their first EP as Bad Meets Evil; the duo formed in 1999. The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011.[106] Eminem was featured on Royce da 5'9\"'s \"Writer's Block\", released on April 8, 2011.[107] On May 3 they released the lead single \"Fast Lane\" from their upcoming EP, and a music video was filmed.[108] In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums.[109] With more than 60 million \"likes\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson.[110] Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period.[111] Early in 2011 he leaked \"2.0 Boys\", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January, and performed it in April.[112] Bad Meets Evil released their next single, \"Lighters\", on July 6 and its music video in late August.[113][114] On August 6, Eminem performed several songs from throughout his career at Lollapalooza with the artists who had been featured on each song.[115]\r\n\r\n2012–13: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\nMain article: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\nEminem announced on May 24, 2012 that he was working on his next album,[116] scheduled for release the following year.[117] Without a title or release date, it was included on a number of \"Most Anticipated Albums of 2013\" lists (including MTV); Complex Magazine ranked it sixth, and XXL listed it fifth.[118]\r\n\r\nHe talked about the album on June 30, 2012, with DJ Whoo Kid on Shade 45; the material was taking shape, and Dr. Dre would be involved.[119] On August 30, Slaughterhouse member Royce da 5'9\" said about it: \"I'm not so sure how the world is going to respond from some of the things that I've heard from him.\"[citation needed] Friend and fellow rapper 50 Cent was confirmed as appearing on the album.[120] Eminem appeared on Pink's \"Here Comes The Weekend\", from The Truth About Love.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 2013, Shady Records president and Eminem manager Paul Rosenberg announced that the rapper's eighth album would be released after Memorial Day. \"We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's been working on it for some time,\" said Rosenberg. \"It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to see what else lines up.\" The album remained untitled.[121] On March 22, Dr. Dre said that he worked with Eminem on the album and it was nearly finished;[122] No I.D. was confirmed as producer.[123]\r\n\r\nOn August 14 \"Survival\", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premièred in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts. According to a press release, the first single from Eminem's eighth album would be released soon.[124][125] During the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced that the album would be entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (following The Marshall Mathers LP) and was scheduled for release on November 5.[126]\r\n\r\nEminem onstate in T-shirt, shorts and baseball cap\r\nAt the 2014 Lollapalooza in Chicago\r\nIts lead single, \"Berzerk\", was released on August 25 and debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three more singles followed: \"Survival\" (appearing on the Call of Duty: Ghosts trailer),[127] \"Rap God\" and \"The Monster\" (with Rihanna).\r\n\r\nThe album was released on November 5 by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records and Interscope Records. Its standard version had 16 tracks, and the deluxe version included a second disc with five additional tracks. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was Eminem's seventh album to debut atop the Billboard 200, and had the year's second-largest first-week sales.[128][129] The rapper was the first artist since The Beatles to have four singles in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100.[130][131][132]\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom The Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The first American artist with seven consecutive UK number-one albums, he is tied with The Beatles for second place for the most consecutive chart-topping UK albums.[133][134][135] The album secured Eminem's position as Canada's best-selling artist, and was 2013's best-selling album.[136]\r\n\r\nOn November 3 Eminem was named the first YouTube Music Awards Artist of the Year,[137] and a week later he received the Global Icon Award at the 2013 MTV EMA Music Awards.[138] On June 10, it was announced that the rapper was the first artist to receive two digital diamond certifications – sales and streams of 10 million and above – by the RIAA (for \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\").[139] On July 11 and 12, Eminem played two concerts in Wembley Stadium.[140] At the 57th Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \"The Monster\".[141][142]\r\n\r\n2014–present: Shady XV and Southpaw\r\nIn June 2014 Eminem and Rosenberg began using the hashtag #SHADYXV on social-networking sites, and the rapper wore a T-shirt with the hashtag onstage. According to an August 25 press release on Eminem's website, the hashtag was the name of an upcoming Shady Records compilation: Shady XV. That day, the first single from the album (\"Guts Over Fear\", featuring singer-songwriter Sia Furler)[143] was released and the album's track list was released on October 29.[144] Shady Records released a cypher to promote the album, in which Eminem did a seven-minute freestyle. \"Detroit Vs. Everybody\" (the album's second single), with Eminem, Dej Loaf, Royce da 5'9\", Danny Brown, Big Sean and Trick-Trick, was released on November 11.[145] Shady XV, released on November 24 during Black Friday week,[146] consists of one greatest-hits disc and one disc of new material by Shady Records artists such as D12, Slaughterhouse, Bad Meets Evil and Yelawolf. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 138,000 copies in the United States.[147]\r\n\r\nThe Official Eminem Box Set, a career-spanning, 10-disc vinyl box set, was released on March 12, 2015. The set includes seven of Eminem's eight studio albums (excluding Infinite), the 8 Mile soundtrack, the compilation Eminem Presents: The Re-Up, and the greatest hits collection Curtain Call: The Hits.[148] Early in the year, it was announced that he would appear on Tech N9ne's \"Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2)\".[149] The song, also featuring Krizz Kaliko, was released on April 20. Eminem also appeared on Yelawolf's \"Best Friend\", the single from Love Story.\r\n\r\nEminem is the executive producer of the soundtrack on the sports drama Southpaw, with Shady Records. The first single from the soundtrack called 'Phenomenal' was released on June 2, 2015.[150] Another single, 'Kings Never Die' by Eminem featuring Gwen Stefani, was released on July 10, 2015 on YouTube via Eminem's Vevo account.[151] Eminem was the first interview of Zane Lowe in Beats 1. The interview streamed online on the Beats 1 radio on [152] July 1, 2015. Eminem appeared on the public access show Only in Monroe, produced in Monroe, Michigan, and was interviewed by guest host Stephen Colbert for an episode that aired July 1, 2015. The rapper, who was referred to throughout the interview by his legal name Marshall Mathers, sang snippets of Bob Seger songs at Colbert's prompting and briefly discussed Southpaw.[153]\r\n\r\nOther ventures\r\nShady Records and D12\r\nMain articles: Shady Records and D12\r\nAfter Eminem's multi-platinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; the rapper and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.[21]\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater.[154] While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan.[155] In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released.[156] The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use). \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex, and renamed \"Purple Hills\". It was a hit but the album's third single, \"Fight Music\", was not as successful.[157]\r\n\r\nAfter their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit single \"My Band\".[156] According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he's busy doing his thing\".[158] D12 released a 2011 mixtape entitled Return of the Dozen Volume 2, with Eminem on one song (\"Fame\"); the rapper was not on the group's previous mixtape, Return of the Dozen.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.[159]\r\n\r\nActing career\r\nAfter a small role in the 2001 film The Wash, Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the quasi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. According to the rapper, it is a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running #1 hip hop single in history).[160] Eminem was absent from the ceremony, and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.[161]\r\n\r\nThe rapper has voiced the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof (as an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer) and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show (currently available on DVD).[162] He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel,[163] and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper.[164] Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People.\r\n\r\nHe played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera.[165] Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit.[166] The rapper had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film, The Interview; during an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem comes out.[167]\r\n\r\nMemoirs\r\nEminem's autobiography, The Way I Am, was published October 21, 2008. Detailing his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak and depression, it includes stories of his rise to fame, commentary about past controversies and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady.\"[168] An autobiography of the rapper's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.\r\n\r\nAdvertising and charity\r\nEminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton's Brisk iced tea, the rapper is a claymation figure.[169] In the second, a two-minute ad – the longest in Super Bowl history at the time – for the 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.[170][171]\r\n\r\nHe established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney.[172]\r\n\r\nArtistry\r\nInfluences and rapping technique\r\nEminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham,[173] Kool G Rap,[174] Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane,[174] Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run–D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.[175] In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats\".[176] In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter,[177] connecting with his audience,[178] carrying a concept over a series of albums,[179] complex rhyme schemes,[180] bending words so they rhyme,[181] multisyllabic rhymes,[174] many rhymes to a bar,[182] complex rhythms,[183] clear enunciation[184] and the use of melody[185] and syncopation.[186] Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics,[187] being a \"workaholic\"[188] and \"stacking\" vocals.[189]\r\n\r\nAlter egos\r\nThe rapper uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. Eminem's best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP. In this persona his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist.[190] Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album's theme.[191] Another character is Ken Kaniff, a homosexual who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, created a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing the rapper.\r\n\r\nCollaborations and productions\r\nSee also: Eminem production discography and Eminem discography § Guest appearances\r\nAlthough Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes' \"Touch It\" remix at the June 27, 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon's single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne's hit \"Drop the World\", and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent's Street King Immortal).\r\n\r\nEminem was the executive producer of D12's first two albums (Devil's Night and D12 World), Obie Trice's Cheers and Second Round's on Me and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre.[192] He has produced songs for other rappers, such as Jadakiss' \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z's \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks' \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo's \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick's \"Welcome 2 Detroit\", and Xzibit's \"My Name\" and \"Don't Approach Me\".[193] Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass,[194] and the rapper co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004 Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac's posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur's mother, Afeni.[195] He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John,[196] \"The Cross\" from the Nas album God's Son[197] and eight tracks on Obie Trice's 2006 Second Round's on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\").[198] The rapper produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\"),[199] and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\r\n\r\nEminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats.[200] One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King.[200] After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\"[201]\r\n\r\nComparisons with other artists\r\nAs a lyricist and a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared to Bob Dylan.[202] Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem, and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him.[203]\r\n\r\nEminem and Christian hip hop artist KJ-52 have been compared to each other, with KJ-52 called his \"Christian counterpart\".[204] KJ-52's single, \"Dear Slim\", was controversial with Eminem fans when it appeared on Total Request Live. Although he said the song was not intended to be disrespectful,[205] KJ-52 received hate mail and the song was number 26 on VH1's Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop list.[206]\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nFamily\r\nEminem has been scrutinized, as a rapper and personally.[37] The rapper was married twice to Kimberly Anne (Kim) Scott. He met Kim in high school; he was 15 and she was 13 when he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J's \"I'm Bad.\"[207] Kim and her twin sister, Dawn, had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989. Their daughter, Hailie, was born on December 25, 1995; they married in 1999, divorcing in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April,[208] agreeing to joint custody of Hailie.[209] He has also adopted Alaina, Dawn's daughter and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship.[210][211] In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had reconciled.[212] He had legal custody of his younger half-brother, Nate Kane.[213] In his 2014 song \"Headlights\", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for, his mother.[214]\r\n\r\nLegal problems\r\nIn 1999 Eminem's mother sued him for about $10 million for slandering her on The Slim Shady LP, receiving about $1,600 in damages in 2001.[215] Eminem was arrested on June 3, 2000 during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested for assaulting bouncer John Guerrera in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw Guerrera kiss his wife.[216][217] Eminem recreated the Guerrera assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. The rapper, charged with possession of a concealed weapon and assault, pled guilty and received two years' probation; Guerrera's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.[218] On July 7, 2000 Kim attempted suicide, slashing her wrists,[219] and later sued Eminem for defamation after he described her violent death in \"Kim\".[217]\r\n\r\nOn October 26, 2000, the rapper was scheduled to perform at Toronto's Skydome when Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. \"I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women,\" he said. Flaherty said he was \"disgusted\" when he read the lyrics of \"Kill You\", which includes the lines \"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?\" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges be brought against the rapper for advocating violence against women in his lyrics.[220] Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, \"Being offensive is Eminem's job description\",[221] and the rapper's Toronto concert went on as planned.[222]\r\n\r\nSanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing him in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song which portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" him and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; the judge, who rapped the verdict, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.[223] On June 28, 2001 Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and fined about $2,000 on weapons charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.[224]\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \"Kill You\" was from his instrumental \"Pulsion\".[225] Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted, and any remaining copies destroyed. A trial date was set for June 2004, and the case was later settled.[226]\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2003 the United States Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem threatened President George W. Bush[227] in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore‍ '​s deluxe-edition bonus disc, with altered lyrics.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's iTunes.[228][229] The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.[230]\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.[231]\r\n\r\nDrug problems\r\nEminem has spoken about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium.[232] According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first \"sobered up\" in 2002.[233] During the production of 8 Mile, the rapper, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount [...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. The rapper's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg), and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me – it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was he: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"[22]\r\n\r\nHis struggle with drugs climaxed with a December 2007 methadone overdose. Eminem had first bought methadone from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". The rapper continued to buy more, until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully detoxed. When he tore his meniscus \"after falling asleep for literally 10 minutes,\" he had surgery; after he came home he had a seizure and relapsed within three weeks. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running, and became sober on April 20, 2008. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him.[22]\r\n\r\nProof's death\r\nOn April 11, 2006 Eminem's best friend, Deshaun (Proof) Holton, was fatally shot in the head and chest by club bouncer Mario Etheridge at the CCC Club on 8 Mile Road in Detroit after Proof shot Keith Bender, Jr. (Etheridge's cousin) to death.[234] Proof was brought by car to St. John Health's Conner Creek Campus (an outpatient emergency-treatment facility), where he was pronounced dead on arrival. On April 19, Eminem, D12, 50 Cent and thousands of others attended Proof's funeral at the Fellowship Chapel in Detroit.[235] Eminem and former Shady Records artist Obie Trice (a fellow Detroit native) eulogized the rapper.[236] He recorded two songs about Proof's death on Recovery (\"Going Through Changes\" and \"You're Never Over\"), and mentions Proof in \"Deja Vu\", \"Beautiful\" and \"Cinderella Man\". In 2010 \"Difficult\", a tribute to Proof, was leaked online.[237]\r\n\r\nAlleged homophobia\r\nSome of Eminem's lyrics have been considered homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country.[238] Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:[239]\r\n\r\nCooper: Some of the lyrics, like, you know, in the song \"Criminal\" you say \"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez, Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress—hate fags? The answer's 'yes'\".\r\nEminem: Yeah, this scene I came up in. That word was thrown around so much, you know, \"faggot\" was like thrown around constantly to each other, like in battling.\r\nCooper: Do you not like gay people?\r\nEminem: No, I don't have any problem with nobody. You know what I mean? I'm just like whatever.\r\nThe rapper is a friend of Elton John.[240] When asked his opinion in a New York Times interview of the legalization of same-sex marriage in Michigan, Eminem replied: \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\",[241] adding that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be\".[242]\r\n\r\nLegacy\r\nLarge graffiti picture of a serious-looking Eminem\r\nEminem graffiti in Shanghai\r\nEminem is considered one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. He was 83rd on Rolling Stone‍ '​s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time[243][244] and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists.[245] In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the seventh-biggest icon in pop-music history.[246]\r\n\r\nHe is the bestselling artist from 2000 to 2010 on the US Nielsen SoundScan;[247] with estimated worldwide album sales of over 172 million, Eminem is one of the best-selling musical artists in the world.[6] The rapper has over five billion views of his music videos on his YouTube Vevo page.[248] In 2010 Eminem's music generated 94 million streams (more than any other musical artist),[249] and in May 2014 Spotify called him the most-streamed artist of all time.[250] According to Billboard, two of Eminem's albums are among the top-five bestselling albums from 2000 to 2010. \"Love the Way You Lie\" (11× platinum) and \"Not Afraid\" (10× platinum) are certified diamond by the RIAA, making him the first artist with two digital diamond-certified songs in the US.[251] In the UK Eminem has sold over 12.5 million records,[252] and more than 33 million track downloads and 45,160,000 albums in the US.[253][254] Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200: seven solo (five original albums and two compilations), two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil.[255] The Eminem Show, The Marshall Mathers LP, and Encore were ranked the third-, seventh- and fortieth-bestselling albums of the 2000–2009 decade, respectively, by the magazine.[256][257] The rapper has had 13 number-one singles worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn August 2011 Eminem was called the King of Hip-Hop by Rolling Stone, which analyzed album sales, R&B, hip-hop and rap chart positions, YouTube views, social media, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011.[5] His second major-label album, The Marshall Mathers LP, was the fastest-selling solo album in US history[36] and was ranked one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time by Rolling Stone, Time and XXL.[258] Rolling Stone ranked it the seventh-best album of the first decade of the 21st century.[259] The album's third single (\"Stan\") is one of Eminem's most critically acclaimed songs, with Pitchfork Media calling it \"a cultural milestone\".[260]\r\n\r\nA number of hip-hop and pop artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including 50 Cent,[261] Usher,[262] Kendrick Lamar,[263] Ed Sheeran,[264][265] Lana Del Rey,[266] Big Sean,[267] J. Cole,[268] Skylar Grey,[269] Bubba Sparxxx,[270] Asher Roth,[271] Machine Gun Kelly,[272] Yelawolf,[273] Hopsin,[274] Tyler, The Creator,[275] Hollywood Undead,[276] Chris Webby,[277] Chance the Rapper[278] Stalley.[279] and Denace. Rap pioneers David Banner,[280] Talib Kweli,[281] Kool G. Rap,[282] Redman[283] and Jay Z have called Eminem one of the greatest rappers of all time.[284]\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\nMain articles: Eminem discography and Eminem production discography\r\nSee also: D12 discography\r\nInfinite (1996)\r\nThe Slim Shady LP (1999)\r\nThe Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\r\nThe Eminem Show (2002)\r\nEncore (2004)\r\nRelapse (2009)\r\nRecovery (2010)\r\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)\r\nFilmography\r\nYear\tTitle\tRole\tNotes\r\n2000\tDa Hip Hop Witch\tHimself\t\r\n2000\tUp in Smoke Tour\tHimself\tConcert film\r\n2000\tThe Slim Shady Show\tVarious (voice)\t\r\n2001\tThe Wash\tChris\tUncredited\r\n2002\t8 Mile\tJimmy \"B-Rabbit\" Smith, Jr.\t\r\nAcademy Award for Best Original Song (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\nASCAP Award for Most Performed Song from a Motion Picture (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\nBMI Film Award for Music\r\nBMI Film Award for Most Performed Song from a Film (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\nCritics Choice Award for Best Song (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\nMTV Movie Award for Best Video from a Film (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\nMTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance\r\nMTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Male Performance\r\nTeen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor – Drama/Action Adventure\r\nTeen Choice Award for Choice Movie Breakout Star – Male\r\n(Nominated) CFCA Award for Most Promising Performer\r\n(Nominated) Golden Globe for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\n(Nominated) Golden Satellite for Best Original Song (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\n(Nominated) Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\n(Nominated) OFCS for Best Breakthrough Performance\r\n(Nominated) PFCS for Best Original Song (\"Lose Yourself\")\r\n2003\t50 Cent: The New Breed\tHimself\tDocumentary\r\n2004\tCrank Yankers\tBilly Fletcher\tSeason 2, Episode 21\r\n2005\t50 Cent: Bulletproof\tDetective McVicar\tVideogame, voice and likeness[285]\r\n2009\tFunny People\tHimself\tCameo[286]\r\n2010\tEntourage\tHimself\tSeason 7, Episode 10: \"Lose Yourself\"\r\n2012\tSomething from Nothing: The Art of Rap\tHimself\tDocumentary\r\n2012\tHow to Make Money Selling Drugs\tHimself[287]\tDocumentary\r\n2013\tDetroit Rubber\tHimself\tWeb Series, Episode 1, also Executive Producer [288]\r\n2014\tThe Interview[167]\tHimself\tCameo\r\n2015\tMotor City\tHimself\tExecutive producer\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Eminem\r\nHe shared the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song Lose Yourself, co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto.His Academy Award win made him the first rapper to receive this award.[289]\r\n\r\nThe rapper has received fifteen Grammy Awards, has been praised for his \"verbal energy\" and lyrical quality and was ranked ninth on MTV's Greatest MCs of All Time list.[290][291] In 2003, he was thirteenth on MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music list[292] and 82nd on Rolling Stone‍ '​s Immortals list.[4] In 2008 Vibe Magazine readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive,[293][294] and he was named Best Rapper Ever in a poll on the magazine's website.\r\n\r\n\"The Real Slim Shady\" (from his second Grammy-winning album, The Marshall Mathers LP) criticizes the awards in its second verse, with Eminem believing at the time that negative opinion of his material would prevent him from ever winning one.
